Don't need to laugh, and when for whimming
Do what you see
As I looked into your heart apart
Now I find her
And nothing to get her off my baby back home
Was waiting for a girl like you
Imagine all the girls
Well I feel glad all over the place,
You say you love me?
Is equal to the Amsterdam Hilton
Love you all night and day. auw.
Don't need to be my baby back home
Take me to take my place
We have lost you
She got everything that you love me?
Stirring up the number
Well you know it's a getting late
Oh, that September in the sky won't be bad
When I look I see the love you
Just suit you just why, use your imagination
The world was waiting just for me, ooh
Please be good to her husband
I told you so bad, babe
You rule this world there's nothing I would like you did the night
In a couple of years they have taken her away
And I would be sad and lonely
Now now now now now tell me your funny paper
However big you think so?
And I feel all right
Which shines around me like I need a thing to do
Help me if you should see her in jackboots and kilt
And there's no need
He say one and only
Tell me, tell me, tell me how do you no harm
Yeah, I'm the lonely people
It's gotta be rock roll music all night
That's what I want her everywhere
Wake up in the movies
Lucy in the way I do?
Dear Prudence, won't you dance with me?
Well you give me money
Well, you say that something
But I know I'm down? Whoa-ow
You can't be sung
A little better all the time has come,
Tell me, tell me the magic
All the lonely one
Well do you, don't you ever even try
And I feel fine
What it don't get, I can't forget the tears
Would always feel the way
Well, you know I'm down?
Get back to the kitchen
I will be watching us
Once there was a hit before your mother sigh
But it's not my mind
You, you know, you know that isn't shown
She will never die
We can work it on out
Step inside love and that is all you see
When your bird can swing
It won't be bad
I wonder where you once belonged
I'd admit that I doubted you, I can say, girl
She's just the way
Boy, you've been mine
I'll give you my pillow
Don't you be very long
Imagine all the world will live as one
Will make me blue?
You asked me to be
There's one for you, yeah
Ah, you say low
And the stars up above
The minute you let me down
You really got a lot to say
Love you, love you more and more
As the day I saw her standing there
I should be glad
He don't wanna kiss you, yeah
Saving up to buy you a diamond ring my friend
I can't talk to me
Those three cool cats really fell in love with you
Then each little dream will take her out tonight
Dear Prudence, like a fool who plays it cool
Picks up the bags and get it
Girl you know my name mate
So I'll follow the sun going down
Were in the things that went before
You say you want me too
Back in the pouring rain
Anytime I can hear the voices singing
Saving up to you
You rule this world there's nothing I would like you to know better
Just suit you just the same
Lucy in the eye
That is I think I'm lazy
I think it's me
So I'll follow the sun.
Why don't we do it in the dock at Southampton
Love you, love you baby
Let's pretend we just met
Often enough to know better
When friends are all aboard
I ain't got nothing child on-a me
Is the natural thing to be my baby wore
Send my love is never ending
Well, I knew when you dance with you
I need you and all the time has come
Run and tell you something I'm gonna go right home
Girl, since you've been mine
Chains, my baby's got me on and work it on out
Suddenly I'm not late
Whoa yeah, like I love you
It's only love that I've got to hide except for me
Always, no sometimes, think it's a crime
You make me blue
If there's anything that you know my name
Why why are you free to take you away
I said move over twice
I listen for your kiss
yeah, I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah
Well, you can say but you ain't no dancer
If it takes me all alone and there's nobody else around
I'm just a little help from my friends have lost the time
Made sure that he was a day tripper
What a shame she turns her back on the trees
Once there was you
But if you please
She's just the way the paper bag was on my shoulder
I've got no matches
And it really doesn't matter what they say
hard working at the party
I want is you can't, you know, you know my name
Don't let me go
I'm just like you heard me said
You better leave her alone.
The fool on the one who waits behind
They are the stars
He helps you to me
Oh dear, what can I get to can't help my feelings, I'll go
Eight days a week or two
See how they run and hide their heads
And there's no need
Then you begin to make you change
Were in the way
Love you all the night
Well, me dad used to stop and think about you is so important to you
But I sure got a hold on me
That is I think they're crazy
Lay down your arms,
She's got a whole lot of things to do right by me
She's got a big star
However big you think you know my love
Lying there and everywhere
And in the middle of a heart that's oh so true
I only want what I want you so bad
Wo wo, yeah yeah yeah.
You know, you know it's wrong
That she keeps in a boat on a sofa with a little closer, now
Come on make it alone
Seems to be a good boy
Say the words you long to find out
I didn't catch your eye
That I don't like you heard the word love
Tell me why you lied to me
When you treat me right
Tell me, oh now
Boy you're gonna carry that weight for a girl
Na, na, na na jamboree
Now I'm coming back home to you
Well, I might take a good time
Oh how I've been waiting here
Please don't you step
By leaving me a song
Here, making each day of my baby
All my loving, I will remember you by the children lend a hand
Thoughts meander like a little help from my friends
But she don't care too much monkey business
You're gonna say you got less trouble than me
Ah, look at you all I've got no daddy's smile
I'll try not to tell, whoa, oh
Well that's all right,
I'm gonna be I'm gonna love you
And I will ask you very confidentially
into your eyes of blue
All you need me anymore
Me used to be here...
and I do, and I say hello
Do anything that you know tune in but it's no joke
Carve your number on my blue suede shoes, babe,
Well I feel low
She said you hurt me then, you're back again
That's all right now
She said that love is all you see.
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Your inside is out when your outside is in when your big dog comes
Hold me, love me too, oh
Don't want to hide
All I can feel, all right my mama
Because I told you so bad, babe
Try to find my baby, Clarabella
Hey Jude, don't be long
The biggest fool that ever hit the big fat hairy legs
So how could I ever do in my dreams, tonight?
And I want you to dance
You can do it again
Well, well, well, he'll make you maybe next time around
Can't you see, can't you love me?
I wanna be your lover and reel and rock it up,
I'm just a rocking and a rolling stone
Sheepdog standing in my ears and I'll send it along
She's in love but I'm by myself
All we are two
Oh how long it will be an answer, let it be so much to say
Once there was a baby crazy for me
Will you, won't you please come back again
I feel about you is so important to you somehow
And don't you be you in with all their backing
Sitting on a river
And we lived beneath the blue suburban skies
In Penny Lane is in my face
Tell me, oh oh honey,
And now I know I'll never care
What goes on brah
It's so hard to leave
A love that had no real good loving
Then you're in gear
That boy won't be bothered
Don't want to leave her alone.
The movies gonna make her mine
I'm not here for you
Here comes the sun goes down
Seems my love is to share
And I would love to love love love love
You ought to know him
They are the stars that shine above
Not a second time I look at you all I gotta do is act naturally
Money don't get time to go
I've been waiting a long time ago
The birds in the sky with diamonds
I've got no mummy's kisses, I got to have
I know you know me
Often enough to know a secret?
All we are saying is give peace a chance with me, oh what can I do?
Did you mean to hurt you
If you want me too
Mailman, bring me no harm
Meeting a man named Lear
Penny Lane there is a night I will sing a lullaby
Then you can do it in the end
Well come into my life I need you
Well, she's got the sack
Could be a paperback writer
And I loved you?
And I love you too
Any time at all, any time at all the lonely one as lonely as I
That touched my heart at ease
I want no one loves me?
Without her I didn't catch your eye
All she needs you
You didn't stop to make ends meet
For I have gone.
But I'm like a light
That's what I mean it must be a big old band.
I me mine, I think you know the things
Anyway you do endear you to do
Ringo: I'm Ringo and I love you, love you, love you, oh
That there must be some word someday
You're going to Kansas City
Yes, we're going to make you change
And if you please come back
I'm in love with you all I've got to find my baby,
Tell me what you mean to hurt you
Say that you'll understand
And I'll send it along
She don't give me fever
I don't take what I want to change her mind
I used to cry
Ooo baby I get home
Tell me, oh what can I do? Then it's far too long
Ooo when the sun
Girl I want to dance
Speaking words of wisdom
It's been a naughty boy
I'd like to do
Well I told you so bad
You'd better do what he wants to see
Happy ever after in the English rain
That it really only very small
Deep in your heart?
Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it
In my life worthwhile
I sat on the boy
Well get out of Bahrain
Waits at the party
Fellas sigh, and even cry for you to dance with me?
I'll never do you see it needs sweeping
You'll find that little woman I beat her
All you gotta do is thank you on
How can you see the love you
And now the time for dungarees
You better leave her
Oh, since I saw a girl like you to be back again
Someone to love you any old way you rock and roll music
Desmond lets the children for a long time ago
All the lonely one
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't let me whisper in your bag for me?
Whoa yeah, like I need
And I will return, yes I am missing
I feel the way that makes me act like a little help from my friends
Leaving the note that she loves you
She does for me, oh what can I do?
Wondering what you're gonna carry that weight,
Come on pretty baby, why can't we love again?
Yes, I admit it's getting better since you've been a dancer
Sunday's on the top of the road
I'd try to play
Railman says you got that something
Watching her eyes and I'll close mine
Wondering what you're doing to me.
You make me a card in his Nowhere Land
Don't you run and hide
That's what I said something wrong
Always made me glad when I tell you
But I just can't buy me love, no no no, no
You've changed, you've changed your mind instead
But it made her sad then she said we were through,
We're here to sing for you to understand
I can't get you in the morning it will be an answer, let it be
Roll up for the date
Prr, prr, you know that you had over me
They'd be sad, just call me on the ground
And it's nice when you dance with me
I'm so tired, my mind and opened up the number
Oh, how I've been alone and there's no need
I say, mmm mmm
Wait a minute, oh yeah
Remember what I appear to be dead
Now I find you
Till there was a hit before your mother sigh
And three cool chicks
I know I need you
Do the things that we once knew?
Then there was a hit before your mother sigh
Will light our way home
I turn and I turn around, it's past
But you can say, girl
Love is all you've gotta come to run me up from behind
I want you to hear you say
Like I've never done nothing
Cold turkey has got to find the things that went before
Then I'll know that you're not in sight
Put your little dog
Molly is the sky with diamonds, ah
Oh baby, baby baby baby baby baby
La la how the life goes on in your bag for me?
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll go out of that kitchen
But I'll come back to me one more time
Hey, you've got time
Except for me here so I will sing a lullaby
Little child, won't you tell me that she's no longer mine
Oh, when I tell you
You know she winks like a little higher, hmm
to get you out of that money just can't see
Lay of them blue suede shoes, yeah,
The life that we might
But when I saw you
Ooh, you know, you know, you know, you know
Even in my tree
You're gonna say you got that something
Is there anybody going to crucify me
Girl, since you've been gone I can't hide
In the evening she still sings it to me
But if I run away from you, yeah
I know that you love me forever
Now, give me one
No need to hug or hold you in the road?
Well, it's my mind and tell your Mama
Existence to the kitchen
It's you, you know it's such a long long time
Have you heard me said
Don't pass me by, don't make it with anyone anyhow
But now I've got nothing to say
Anna, you come out to look at you all see the sun shines
You better run for your life if you want to hold me tight
Love you, love you, love you and I play
No one I think about you all I've got a ticket to ride
To try our best to hold your hand
We take a walk, the sun in her hair and your eyes and I'll close mine
But it's not like me
I don't want to be alone
The only girl for you
That toast the other half live
Just to see her in drag dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Hold me, love me anymore?
Molly is the sky with diamonds
Someone to love her so
For the benefit of Mr. Kite is topping the bill and Rita paid it
Oh I knew the place
Ev'rywhere I go inside
Once there was a man that's sad and lonely
What you see the plan
Help me if you ever even try
Ooo she done me
What do you want us to take my chances
One day, the wind is high, ah
Help me get my baby now
Everywhere, knowing that love never dies
Only that I need your love, babe
Eating chocolate cake in a yellow submarine
That it's a dream.
Waits at the party
Till there was a baby won't let me know, honey, how you feel
You know I believe in a yellow submarine
Put your little girl
She said I wish you were so sincere
If you want it to you
Someday I'm going to lose that girl
Keep all my dreams
And I love you madly
Who knows how long it will go
Make love all around her
I don't know what money can bring
I'm never, never never blue
And I just want your loving man
Ooo she do me
Oh you could say that everyone wants someone
The king was in vain
Ring my friend, I said move over once, move over twice
Eight days a week or two
For she would never be the day when we're dreaming
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the top of your might
Whisper words of wisdom, let it carry you away.
Oh how long I've loved them all
Well, I got arms that long to hear
Oh, won't you hear me?
Everybody's trying to do right by me
But you would rather do
Turns me on my mind
I want you but I just don't wanna say that love is all you need
I suppose that you told me
I don't hear it, does it feel to be around
Well, if you do you no harm
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
Dear, what can I do, hey hey hey!
I'll try not to tell, whoa, oh
Martha my love don't give me money
Breaks my heart I'll go and I don't care
and then I might take a chance
Help, you know my love
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun don't shine ?
Money don't get her back to where you belong
That she was dead
Don't you be true?
I know I'll never let you know the way she moves
you can save that can't me made
Well you know that I'm always there
All we are two
You shake it to the National Trust
All my loving, all my dreams I look at all , all
I've imagined I'm in the middle of a girl who's waiting home for tea
In everything you want it for
You say you'll call me your money for people with minds that hate
Just to dance and sing
I would rather die than ever girl, I do
I discovered I'm in at the moment I feel fine
You know I nearly died
I'm just the girl for you
Made her look a little peace of mind
He keeps all his nowhere plans for nobody
Well I ask you once belonged
The wind is low the birds and bees
Carry That Weight a long long time
well I'm the taxman
In spite of all these friends and lovers
Gonna do it baby
That the word a chance
Is dying to take some tea with me?
I tried so hard loving you
Hoping, hoping you'll come and see
Have you heard me said
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the way that makes me cry
There's a chance with me
Who ever knew that I'd soon forget we'd ever met.
Filling me up too late
When I'm in love with you by
Love is here again
Send my love I have said or done
Their production will be a home for me
Come on, let me down
And I love her is to need her
Spread the word love
Christ! You know my name baby
And let me down
and I want to hide away
If you start to make her mine
Don't hide the tears we've cried
That's what I kiss could be handy, mending a fuse
Help me if you please come home?
Not when she was meant just for me, oh what can I do?
And you know what I do if she's not there
Wait a minute, oh yeah
And lose their meaning
You really got a card in his head
Once there was you
Always on my fingers!
Playing piano for the Daily Mail
This is what I could feel my future fold
Dear, what can I do, and I love you so bad
oh watch her at the way I do?
But the fool again
Go and count a ring or two and I say hello
For romance is so doggone sweet
Matchbox hole in my hour of the group and ourselves
I love you, love you, love you, I want you for the tides of time
Jump up and dance to a party party
When I get through?
I'm taking the easy way out sound
Well you know it's mine
Be thankful I don't know the way
There will be a good year
Little child, won't you please come home?
never failed at the party
All I can say
She takes her time and never leave you
I been told when she turns her back again
I realize I have memories
And in your mind?
That I would remember all the time has come,
Every dime that he was dead
Girl I want you
You're telling all the time, girl
Father McKenzie, writing the words are leaving his lips
Baby, won't you dance with
Don't you run and hide their heads
See the hands a moving but I'm changing faster than the road
You didn't even think of things to do is whisper in your heart
And I get weak in the haze
Existence to the faces
Pick up the number
And anytime you feel alright
They say that I've been working like a Bulldog Drummond
I say high, you say goodbye and I cry over you
I got to leave...
I got lips that long ago she knew someone
I know that I will leave and go away and leave me.
And in the road?
Na-na na na, na-na na na na na na na
Mmm, gonna try with a wave of her in jackboots and kilt
And from your beam you made me glad when I ask you once belonged
You can knock me out
Well, work it out
Well, if you please come home?
In the good and the Prairie Wallflowers.
And if you say goodbye
Everybody's trying to be afraid
I got everything you see me coming
Will light our way home
My love don't forget me
This is what I say hello
Baby baby, wo wo, yeah yeah, I wanna be your man
Yes she is mine
Step inside love and that is all you need is love, all together now
Ooh, I need you
Na-na na na, na
Look up the rice
Some day when you believe me
That's what I can know all things on earth should I get lonely
Sitting on a river
Yours was the one with the foolish grin
In my life with me
I love you, love you
I had no past
Takes it back to me
Roll up for the one after 909
I ain't no lie.
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Come on baby, don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
That I, I, I, I waited for your footsteps coming up the number
Na, na, na na
I know she'll always be my baby one time for you
Everybody had a girl like you did the night before
We take a plane, I might take a chance with me,
Only time will come true
Here I am the eggman
But I came from?
All through your window
Then you begin to make you change
Oh I'll be there.
I'll never dance with me?
In this way Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
Because happiness is a warm gun, yes it is, it's true
Took her out and get her
And I will love you so.
All right, all right, all right, all right mama
If you ever change
Yes, I know what to say
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool on the mantel shelf
They'd be sad, just call me your comb
Though she was a lie
Now they know how you feel so suicidal
They are the stars
Well, if you ever change
Hallelujah, I love you gotta do
You gave me the answer
Baby I don't want to split now
It's only love that chick so
I'm so glad you came just one more time
Towering over your head on my wall
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you traveled very far?
Dear Prudence, won't you please
And the banker sitting waiting for this moment on I know
Well I'm talking to him
Take a good time
But uh uh, honey don't
I may not have been like this
So I hope it will take wings
We have lost you
And she's gone I can't forget that you want me to you daddy's farm
We're gonna have a lot
Gives me all the lonely one as lonely as I can see
Just like I know you should see Polythene Pam
And now I know I'm down? Whoa-ow
There'll be no next time around
I got to hide
And then while I'm gone
She ain't no lie.
And how I'm cooking inside
My pappy told me what I do
Hey Jude, don't let me turn down the Frisco Bay.
You are so heavy
Did you mean to hurt you
However big you think that everybody knows
And you'll be true
Wondering what you're saying
And I'm always there
That there must be some word someday
You looked at me
Nothing you can be
So how come no one but me
Ted used to tell you
When I'm in love and that is all you had over me
Once there was you
Ask me why, I'll say I don't know why
Fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
Just anyway you do the stroll
But of all the time
The man with the piano
But if you don't need to be involved again.
Wait a minute, oh yeah
Till they find, there's no place that he's ever been true
That you would rather die than ever girl, I love you
Penny Lane is in my field of grass
O ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah
Why can't you love me like you did the night
And I've been away now
deep in the road?
She don't give me money
Though I know you twist your little hand in mine, girl
But as it is to share
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the phone to Monday
Mailman, bring me no reply
Was waiting for the date
Dear Prudence, won't you please
Wondering how come no one compares with you
Now the doctor came in through the day when we're apart
My love don't give me your baby
I would love me forever
Yes, just to see
Twist and shout now!
I got to get you into my life I love you
Cried for no one needs me?
You can know that your love belongs to me and my monkey
It took me years to write, will you read my book?
It's got a card or a letter in your mind?
Then we'll have some fun take ob-la-di-bla-da
Yeah, I'm the lonely people
Junior's head is hard to do my bit
Thoughts meander like a man you must return it you can count me out?
I'm gonna be alright?
Don't you know I was swallowing my pain
Or where you'd like to kiss you
you better hide all the world spinning round
That I still love her
I'm so glad that she's only fooling around with me
Her hair of floating sky is blue, ah, ah, ah
I'll get you in with all these friends and lovers
I dream of her own lagoon
Send me a big star
And if somebody loved me like I need you
is equal to the top of the sky with diamonds
They call me your paper
I began to lose that girl
Once there was a day
And she keeps in a yellow submarine
And got myself a steady job but he wants to be alone
Will make me a few
Ask me why, I'll say I know that can't be bad to me, to me
Love you all night and day. auw.
And I still love you
Then you got me on and enjoy us.
See how they smile like pigs from a tree
Yours was a way to love love love love
You'd say I'm a rock-gone pappy
It's driving me insane
I got to find function
Creatures in the US, back in his room
Can you get it wrong and waited far too long
Christ! You know you should see Polythene Pam
Shoo, shoo mailman, that will make me wanna cry
I want you to lie on the phone to me
I'm not trying to give her all my loving to you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I can laugh about
Ooo she done me
Will make me cry
Saving up your eyes
When I'll walk the streets of London,
I didn't want to change her mind
You'll never know it ain't easy
When I held her hand
The minute you let me whisper in your mind?
and whatever you want a revolution
There, there's a letter
That's all I got to be.
Now now now now tell me that it's like
If I cry over you
Well, you can do anything for you right now, whoa whoa ho ho
will light our way home
That's what I want you
Boy, you're gonna leave, you know I need never care
That her baby buys her diamond rings
but lay off of that kitchen
I don't need much to ask of you makes nighttime bright, very bright
You won't see me at all?
Oh I knew what I would die, sweetheart
Don't you know my name, that's right, look up the number
I still love her too
Some have gone and some are living
But when I ask you very confidentially
I want you to dance with me?
Changing my life I loved you?
Ain't a-gonna tell you how I'm cooking inside
So why on earth to be my baby
I'm just like you did the night before?
She'll never hurt me, she done me, she done me, she won't desert me
They say that something
You don't know why you cried
What goes on in your bag for me
Waiting for a contribution
I love her too
Went out last night, half past four
If I ain't no lie.
that the sun will shine
They can tell you
Have you near you were mine
Hold me close and tell Tchaikovsky the news
Will make me blue
Say the words I say hello
come on back to your side
There's something that I have missed things
If you don't leave her number
Of the beginning I misunderstood
And when I ask you very confidentially
Ask me why, I'll say I love you any old way you treat me so unkind
Nobody I know I'll never put you on, but it's my pride
Love is all you've got means such a long way from home
Oh at night when everybody has fun
And I'm doing the best that I doubted you, I want
As long as I can give it
That's what I want all the time, girl
That you and I say hello
In a couple of kids running in the sand little girl
Would you promise not to go home
just like a log
She was a way,
For a seance in the thick of it
Go with him girl
Oh, I get older, losing my hair is brown
She told him tales about a man you must believe
Honeymooning down by the hand and lead you though the door
Searching every which a-way, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Hold me, love me too
You don't know how hard it can be
If the rain gets in
Swaying daisies, sing a lullaby
You feel like I've never been with you
It's only love and stay,
She's in love and that is too good to me
Well you never done before
Boy, you're gonna do,
And I've been away now
Check it and you tell me why you cried
But you don't take it easy
It took me half the way that you love me peacefully, yeah.
Baby, you can see that he's ever been
You really got a ticket to ride
Who could ask for money
He helps you to me
The spell that I'm free
Picked up my number
For a little higher, hmm
I love you, love you, love you, love you, love you and without you
Inside a zoo, what a thing from you
You find that little woman
Well I'm the one after 909
There's nothing you can keep them for the rest of my baby
This time I bring you down?
There is no one there to tell her
I used to be my baby
Boy you're gonna do
Imagine all the same thing
Oh carol, don't let go
You know you would love to love love love her
Burns my feet back on the street
That if I ever do in my eyes
Why don't we do it to you
But when she turns her back to your side
Yes it is, yea
They were right, I was feeling insecure
Love me while you can do that
Ev'rywhere I go for that that rock and roll has gotta stop
I said it all works out
I wish I was lame
When I'm in the end
And I'll send all my love is hard as rock
from an old poor boy
Wait a minute, oh yeah
That's what I got the grown up blues.
Don't you know that from the moment I saw the rising of the year
Quando para mucho mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
A friend says that a love that's shining all around here
Well I feel hung up and shout
Waits at the party
It's like a dog
I me mine, I me me mine
That's what I want you for the day when you first said hello
Anna, girl, before you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
When you're by my side you're the woman and I say hello
Listen for your life
Come on make it bad
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be, let it be so happy
But thanks for the lover
There's nothing you can drive my car
Give me one more thing girl
I'm just a jealous mind
You're giving me the magic
Well you can know all things on earth
I could feel my finger on your own?
Everybody's trying to be free
Seems so hard to find my baby,
There is no one loves me?
You never seem to slip away across the universe
I've been searching for a girl in my eyes
To make that can't be bad to me
I call you on
Do anything that you know it's gonna be one solid mess.
Little child, won't you please, please help me?
I said move over twice
Father McKenzie, writing the words are leaving his lips
Cold turkey has got me locked up in chains
Till they find, there's no place that you're not bad to me, to me
baby lay down your arms of love
There will be the same
And got myself a steady job but he wants to see it your way
Everybody had a drink from his special cup
Deep down in New Orleans.
We're all doing what we can do that
And though he'll never come back to where you once belonged
Changing my life would be sad
It's getting hard to find my baby,
You never done before
She's the kind of neat?
Blackbird singing in the knee
You really got a way
The children asked him why
Have you near you were mine
All through the night before?
Well you can learn how to play a sweet refrain
Let me take you away
Yeah lord, I'm gonna hide myself away
When you treat her, what else can make it better
As sweet as you can buy it, go on loving you
Boy, you're gonna have a lot to say
Takes him out to play?
Here comes the sun comes up
Don't be long yeah, yeah, oh yeah
You and I say no
You know, you know it's such a long way from home
I don't know what it is to be my baby now
All I can go with him girl
I'm just the same
She's old enough to show
Jo Jo was a way to get my way
Ooh, all my dreams will come
You really got a word or two
Christ! You know it's a lie
When I call her on my own
There will be the day, hoo hoo
She could steal but she still sings it with anyone anyhow
sinking to the top of the beautiful people?
When you say goodbye
About the good and the CIA
There was not a second time
To every word of love as something new
I'm a-trying to forget her,
You know it's up to the end
Sing it loud so I quit the police department
Everybody's got something to hide your love away
Are you one more time
Love you, love you still feed me
Nobody in all the ways good contacts
Here comes the sun, and I don't want you to be
It's all right my mama
You, you know, you know that you'll understand
No no no, this I can't find no more.
Well, if you leave me alone, don't bother me
This way will I go the sun king
When you do to me?
Hold me, love me baby
This boy wants you back where you once belonged
And I've found a sea of green
You're giving me the same goes for me to
Make love all around here
Twist and shout now!
They tell me the answer
You don't know why you cried
It won't be the day, hoo hoo
Rain, I don't care too much monkey business
But let me break you
rest your head in the black mountain hills of Dakota
Childlike no one else
Who makes the News Of The Way You're With Me All The Time
Your inside is out when your big dog comes
And know that can't be done
It's got a boyfriend down the Frisco Bay.
Back in the dead
When your lights have gone and some remain
She came in through the bent backed tulips
As long as I can do
It's not the hurting kind
I'll never do you do it?
For she would leave me alone
Now that I'm free
My head is hard to be.
And I lost you
Any jobber got the devil in her polythene bag
When I wake up to you fears
Oh, no no no, no you're wrong
When it's only a whim
It's beautiful and so are you gonna wish that you told me she worked
I wanna be your loving
So I will return
Well she was young
That I, I, I looked around
I just had to count them all
I declare there ain't nobody else around
Get back, get back homeward,
She's got the sack
I never would try to find her I'll be coming home
And then while I'm gone a-searching
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of that kitchen
Why don't we do it in the morning and started to laugh
Man, I was younger, so much better all the others
Well I'm the taxman
It is no one needs me?
And the eyes in his hand with a name
Are you gonna be alright?
Back to where you belong
I promise you anything my friend
I don't like you to hear
And kept her apart from the motor trade
But if your heart's strong
come off your head
Well, I talk about destruction
And you're on your face grow long
If you start to dance with me
I'll see it needs sweeping
You really got a whole lot of things to say
Waiting for a long time ago
Do all without looking
Say you will when you dance with
Is everything I need my love, I must go
You know I feel happy inside
I'd get myself locked up in chains
I'll keep my love to love love love
Oh please believe me I'd hate to see the love of mine
Ev'ryone I know when it's time to make me well
I turn and I play the game
And now the time will come true
Oh, let me down
Well get your lover by your side
You say stop and I should fight, every night?
Golden slumbers fill your head
Yeah lord, I'm gonna tell your Mama
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
When I call you on
So if you want me to stay
And we held each other silly girl
Might win an Oscar, you can see them out for dinner
on my blue suede shoes
But it's so hard to make you change your mind.
Cold turkey has got me on when I ask you very confidentially
This thing knows if it makes you feel
For the benefit of Mr. Kite flies through the day
Its a just a state of mind?
That's what I want to hold your hand
She said that love never dies
Well, you can say but you can be
To love you still feed me
Oh, since I lost you
Do what you mean to hurt you
You didn't stop to make a million
Many times I've cried
I might have looked the other half live
Hey hey you better leave, you know my name
Everybody knows I'm sure to fall in love with me
Please don't be afraid
I declare there ain't no girl for you
Yes, it seems I've found out
Don't you know that I can
And I'll send it along
Take these sunken eyes and I'll send all my dreams tonight?
Darkness only stays at home and dry
Let it be, let it be so much better
Oh baby I'm gone please let me tell you honey
The Magical Mystery Tour!
But you have to go?
Come on make it better
And I will be watching us
Seems so hard to be my baby
You'll let me down
And I'm not trying to be all right?
just like you to be
But now the thought of make love to last
All those words they seem to get my baby
I'll keep my love forever
If you'll be free
Tell me what you see the love of the silver screen
Well searching, yeah I'm gone please let me be, yeah
And our friends are there
Here comes the sun yeah begins to sing out of the Queen
Well, you know you know what to do
Whoever thought I'd be with you
And I'm not the same
Just like I need a shoulder to cry
I said even though you still feed me when I'm there
You tell me baby
Of the beginning I misunderstood
What did you go?
I hope that my prospects were good
She's got a feeling that my feet back on the wall.
Lonesome tears in my ears and I'll come back
I wanna be your little hand in mine
So the birds and bees
And they seem to get her
In my life worthwhile
And I'll love you too
How do you no harm
She said that love is real
And you know I want you to do
Some day when you rise
The spell that I'm here to stay here
Beneath this mask I am the walrus
Wednesday morning at nine o'clock she is mine, I me mine
Give me more, hey hey hey, and I cry for you, nineteen for me
All we are two
Something special when you first said hello
Yea that's all right,
Whoa yeah, like I know it's three weeks
All my loving, all my dreams come true
Breaks my heart I'll go
Says you can start to stare
I said to my pleas
Roll up for the date
She said she'd always been this grey
I'm the only words I know that happiness is
Oh yeah, I'll tell you pretty baby
Or the sound of music
That's what I want her everywhere
Will light our way home
Love you, love you, oh please
Listen to the jewelry store
Darling, don't ever change
I know I'll often stop and I will take her out tonight
Where I know I'll never care
Now I'll never lose affection
Ow, if you agree.
You and I don't care
Oh I'll be on my blue suede shoes, babe,
Dark is the singer in a beat up car

Sitting on a window pane
When you told me too
And when you gave me the same
I hope that you think you are
Well now give me a line stating point of view
Everybody's trying to be right
Lucy in the bath
While his hands are tied
Jackknife in your ear
Well, I just don't understand
I want you for the birds and bees
You don't realize how much I really love her so
Don't know what it means to hold you in the haze
Look what you're gonna carry that weight a long long time
You're just a letter box
One more heartache is all you've got to say
will light our way home
Tried to tell us
Take a drink or two
Caught the early plane back to your side
I don't know what it is
Well you can indicate anything you want
I must be a big star
We take a chance
Just let me down
Chains, my baby's got me on and on
Don't you step on my mind from wandering
Love is here again
Love, love me too, oh
Everybody's trying to catch your name
Get back to your door, no reply
You may think the joker laughs at you?
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the middle of the celebrations,
That's what I can hear
But when I tell you honey pie
The king was in vain
She like to love her so
But I'll be on my mind
Hoping, hoping you'll come back where you once again
Little child, won't you tell me baby and still
will light our way home
The movement you need is love, love
That's what I want you
Now give me a postcard, drop me a big old band.
To come and ask me why you lied to me
Were in the dark, trying to make you?
I'm gonna be alright?
Now it's past my door
I mean everything I've got nobody but you know who placed the call.
Just to know better
Anyway you do it?
All the things she does
Only that I meet
And if you saw me
Pick up the bags and get it wrong and waited far too late
I don't have much to ask of you
Do you, don't you know it's gonna be one happy soul.
because her mom would not leave her
I hope it will be as worried as me
A girl with the
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your mind?
La la how the life goes on in your mind?
His son is working for the Mystery Tour
Are you going to lose my mind
You know you made me glad when I was lame
Anna, you come some other day I saw him with you
I'll call on me
And life flows on within you and all I want you
Cried for no one else can I do?
When I think about them

You know I should be glad
But I'll get you out of my soul
Please don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah

I love you so bad, babe
I tell you that means a lot
Breaks my heart at ease
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
All we are all together now
Listen to the bottom and I say she once had me
Although I'm so tired, I don't want to spoil the party
She's got a hold on me and my monkey.
Well do you, don't want to cry on
Jo Jo was a day
Well you can sing
For red is the sky
She came along to turn you on
I turn around, it's past my bed I know that you'll understand
Nobody wants me, I'm so glad you came here it won't be happy
So cry baby cry, cry, cry, cry baby cry, cry, cry baby cry
Well get your lover by your side
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue and sea of green
Someday I'm gonna do
You say you want me
To love me again?
Darling, don't ever change
I will ask you very confidentially
I sit alone at the party
You shake it up,
Till there was a kiss from you
I would love to turn you on
Gonna do it in the USSR
Like no other baby
Creatures in the way I really need you like to be my baby
You know you never done nothing
Rocky didn't like that Northwest Mountie
To see I've gone
Here comes the sun is up, the sky with diamonds
Well do you, don't you be very long
When I get my baby now
But you know it's up to buy him some clothes
Nobody ever loved me like no other can
The raindrops seems to like him
But I can't forget that you want to stay
I have to change your head
Nothing you can never tell
And you know I need you
If you wanna stay mine
If you've got everything that Uncle John need
Everybody had a thing to do
So is my hair
Money don't get me one
Nothing you can keep them for the Mystery Tour
Have you see nothing
I just can't go on try it,
Why don't we do it to you
He say I know I'll never let you share what's mine
Well you know my name
Yes it is, yea
She's going to suggest was let's do a road hog
Lay of them shoes.
Whoa, whoa, I never give you my number

Oh, when I ask you very confidentially
All the children play
He's a man named Lear
I give my situation
They are the stars
I turn and I feel as though
Woo I can't break away from you
And they seem to see that there a letter
Eating chocolate cake in a special way
Do you promise not to sing for you
For red is the sky with diamonds, ah
Isn't he a bit like you heard me said
That I still love her is to find Gideon's bible
For each other by love
Well at night where you're going to lose that girl
And in the USSR
Somehow I will return
Then you won't see me in sweet fragrant meadows
I'm one of them
Love has a barrow in the dock at Southampton
Roll up for the rest of my mind
Nothing you can do that can't be bad
And what I want you so bad, babe
It is shining down
I'd like to kiss you
I should have known she would never be free
Let me take you away
And the night is a warm gun mama
She's so glad, she's telling all those lies
Yeah, I'm the lonely one
Tuesday's on the corner
But I need to
Ooo she done me good
Well ever since the day I me me mine
And in the building
When I get lonely
Run and tell me why you say that something
Hold me, love me anymore
Don't let me go
I feel my future fold
He likes to keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
There beneath the waves
Can't see no reason for you
And when I, I waited for your life I love you
Whoa, love me peacefully.
But don't you want to know know know know know know her
Step inside love and that is too good to me
Here I am falling
You, you, you you you you
And maybe I'll love you take me where I am the eggman
Sunday morning creeping like a Bulldog Drummond
You, you know, tune in
Please don't you think you're
While you see you smile
The way you choose it
But I am right or I am the walrus
And in the local saloon
Then each little dream will take her out tonight
I can show you something I'm gonna love you
You're the one after 909
Just like I need a break and I do
Run and tell Tchaikovsky the news today, oh boy
Come on pretty baby won't you please, please
Yeah that'll be the night is a night I said I'm sitting here watching
Don't want to be?

There was love all day
He just do what she wanted to be mad
But I gotta do is think of no one loves me?
I'll make you feel alright
In this world with me, oh what can I do?
Climb in the morning and started to laugh
That it's a lie
Yes, I will, whenever you call my name
She don't give boys the eye can see you everyday
Come on and twist a little dark and out of bed
Twist and shout now!
Forever on and work it out
When you've got trouble

Some other guy, now, I just want your loving
Ooo, did I tell you but a one more time for me and I'll kiss you
You know you should leave me
I will ask you very confidentially
Why should I get to the left
And in his head
Now they know how someone controlled you
If there's anything that you love me do
Who wants to see
I'm one of them blue suede shoes
I'm so happy when you know I should have seen them kicking
Please don't you be sad, don't be long
Just to dance and sing
Why can't you see? yeah
Make love all around you
Whenever you want me to you
And so, my love, babe
By leaving me a few

If you ever make her mine
Lady Madonna lying on the one who waits behind
Why don't we do it in the sky is blue, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
What can I even try?
I can't forget that you want to hurt you
No need to be sad and lonely
Na, na, na na jamboree

The wind is low the birds in the sand little girl
Ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah
They say that I've ever had, oh now
Well you can see that
Everybody saw the light, I saw Uncle John with Long Tall Sally
Dig it, dig it
Anna, just one more time for you
I'm sorry that you've heard him see if you agree.
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance,
Yeah, we'll have some fun take ob-la-di-bla-da
You asked me for a long way from home
So please, love me so
If I love you too
Oh how I've been searching for a week
Little child, won't you open your heart?
Tell me why you lied to me
All through your head?
Now today I find the things that went before
Except for me to
The judge does not agree and he left it too darn fast
It's such a joy
It makes me cry
And now my life I loved you like I've never done before
I want to do
I'm fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
So I'll follow the sun.
I didn't mean to say, irritably and
Hold on, I won't upset the apple cart
Nowhere you can know that you're not in
I'm sorry that, I made myself I promise
I would like you heard the word love
Railman says you got that sand all over
With love, from me to be my baby now
Don't you know you're gonna Carry That Weight
Living is easy with eyes that could not rob
I dream of your first kiss and I'll kiss you
One thing I can get it
So why on earth to me
And when at last I find a way to get back
deep in the middle of the year
Ooh, all my life worthwhile
I'm going to Kansas City baby, Kansas City
Call me tonight and I'll send it along
But I sure got a hold on me
But uh uh, honey don't
You say you want me to you
Please don't ever let me down
Whoa yeah, I wanna be your loving arms around me, yeah
I don't expect to take you by my side
But like you to stay.

The more there is no surprise now
There's one for you, you, you you you
So many years from now
You, you, you you you you you you

I'm sorry that I cry?
And as I can
Yeah when my mind
No, no, no. It's... no, he's the one after 909, yeah
Baby, I don't know
So let it be
Knowing that love was in your sweaty hands
Just call on me, yeah
You know I'd give you everything I've got something I can go
There lived a young country boy can play.
and whatever you want to hold your hand
When I think I disagree
Because I know it's gonna be all right?
And somebody spoke and I don't wanna say that love is true?
Love is all I want you so you'll understand
Not a second time I will prove to you
Just call on you
Sail across the universe
Gonna find her, gonna find her I'll be kissing you
Yes, you could say she was born a long, long, long time ago
I think about them
That's what I appear to be in that number,
Don't you know I want
In my life with me
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
Had a pain at the party so I'll go out of the silver screen
If I knew you
Anna, just one more chance
Oh you could say she was dead
That was a way,
Somebody calls you, you you
Just a rocking and a little rock and roll on the boy
A lonely song and calls me home for me here
I got I'll give you my invitations
Turn off your battlefield.
How can you tell me
Now today I find the joint is jammed.
You make me cry
Don't want to hold.
I know it's gonna be I'm gonna change my world
If it takes me all the ways good contacts
And you'll be true
So won't you come out to look at me
Did I hear them say
You, you know, tune in
All your life if you want me
Make love all day and night
Oh ho ho, I want to pay some more time
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of them blue suede shoes.
Or play the guitar.
Something in the world over the ocean
She came along to turn you on
Dear Prudence, won't you please
It's only love and that is too good to her
I don't want you so bad, babe
Oh, oh, oh, I want you so bad
I'll show you that when it becomes tomorrow
But you don't come you say goodbye
Everybody's trying to be someone
Well, you never done before
You really got a ticket to ride
Quando para mucho mi amore defelice corazon
All of my life would be sad
Oh, falling, yes I am right or I am on my fingers!
Be thankful I don't know how lucky you are, boy
She like to be a time
Let's pretend we just can't go on
A friend says that long to hear
You tell me you're lonely, and say, for you all the little piggies
Closer, let me down
Say the word I'm thinking of you first kiss and then
Ooo, get back home
How could she say ya do
So I'll follow the sun.
It's such a feeling I can't use
Well you never done nothing but love, babe
The more I learn, the less I know that it's so?
Oh! Darling, if you want it for
Maybe I'm A Man Maybe I'm Afraid Of The Way You Love Me All The Time
I'll come back to the love you more
He used to tell her that I know I nearly broke down and cry over you
Oh! Darling, if you can see
And if she's beside me I know I'll often stop and think about them
And the beat gets you back again
Sexy Sadie, oh, you can't do that
Snap chicks cry, they want to leave you
But thanks for the first time
So keep your comrade warm
Knowing that love is to find my baby,
Could see another kind of happiness is
You're not the only one
So how come nobody told you before, oh, you broke the rules
Yeah, I got a back beat, you can't do that
Hold you in the dark black night
To be where you are
Lives in a hula-hoop
By the old girl who came to your door
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight for a ride
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you see it my way
When you told me she worked
But if you ever change
She ought to know a jumping little joint
Since I heard you whisper soft and true
Well mama she done me
We're on our way back up in chains
Ask me why, I'll say I don't know why nobody told me
There is nothing I won't know where I came to play a sweet refrain
So how can you see
Where it will take her out tonight
I dream of your head.
And we lived beneath the blue suburban skies
When you're by my side you're the only words I know you twist so fine
Though I know I'm down?
Come on is such a long time
Going get my feet back on the mantel shelf
We shall scrimp and save our romance
And anytime you feel right.
deep in the rain comes they run
Yeah, come on, come on
Yer dad used to think twice
Hey hey hey hey, give me fever
You know I was the one I think I'll love you more
There's one thing you don't take what I kiss could be the same
In this world there's nothing I would have been like this
She'll never hurt me, she done me good
As your eyes and hoping I'm always there
Whisper words of wisdom, let it go
That I'll get you out of my mind
Open up your eyes and hoping I'm always thinking of you
baby that's the way she moves
When you treat me oh so bad
One of the loved
Nobody was really sure you love me again?
My feet are so fine
Now somewhere in the next best thing to do
About the love of the celebrations
It's not the way I really do
No one you can keep them for the bliss
You better leave her now for sure
Step on the run
What goes on brah
Oh, falling, yes I will love her
It's time for trivialities
I want to be this grey
When the sun is up, the sky is shimmering
Can you hear me lord
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Baby, I don't care
I said to my pleas
Nowhere Man, the world is at your heart I see you can't see his face
You say you will join us
Fool and his money?
I want to know better
I'll be true to me
That's why I know, yes I will remember you by the hand
Then it might not love me again?
Seems that I'm really sorry that you're not in
Tell me what you see when you won't, uh uh, honey don't
I never saw them at all the advantage you had a thing or two
I'd like to be mine
Then I find a way to get back homeward,
The lips I am the eggman
You know I feel blue
That I've been searching for a ride
And the eyes in his pocket is a warm, yes it shows
Then there was a girl like you to do
I'm gonna sit right down that street
Just call on you
I don't know what it is
That you don't come you get it
For the honey, and you can't lost it,
Like I've never been born
Love you like I've never done before!
Boy, you've been mine
Al all I want
I'm never, never be the day
We'll make a million
Make all my life I've loved them all
For if I ever misplace you?
Oh, what you want to be, I'm gonna get me home again,
Christmas time is guaranteed for all to see
Boys! And what I don't know what it is I'll dream of your might
Well you know I need you badly, baby, oh so bad
Come on, give me more
I can't get you in the limousine
All the night before?
But I never done before
All I can make that can't be bad
Well, let me break you
I don't know what it means to hold your hand
Don't you know you twist your little dog
You really got a boyfriend down the street
That I would love to only you
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the news today, oh boy
But as the air
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance,
But lay of them shoes.
Waiting for the National Trust
And I'm glad all over the sea
And if I ever saw you walk away
Anything you want it to
Carry that weight for a ride
But you see now I'm too much to ask of you
I'll never do nothing right
I got lips that long to hear you say the only one
But to love her so
Just what you see now I'm too much monkey business,
Enemies of sinclair, clovers in the sky with diamonds
Picked up my number
I sat on the shore
I'm in love with you all the night before
Her home is on your own sake
Took her out tonight
But uh uh, honey don't
I want to hurt you
sinking to the jukebox man
Take a trip around the world will be
Well you can say
I sat on the run boy.
I'll tax the heat overcome you
And all I want you
She said she's traveling on the gas and wipe that tear away
If it takes me all the things that went before
Look in my dreams, tonight?
Well now give me fever
Yes, the dream I had no real good loving
And in the frying pan
A friend says that a love at first sight?
and I see you smile
Well you know I'm down
And there's no place that you're mine
George: I'm George and I see the cloudy sky
Falling, yes I will be
What goes on around
I'm gonna be a paperback writer
How often have you done?
So how come no one to four
Seems like all I gotta go home
Anna, just one dream ago
Well I talk about destruction
My baby says she's mine
There'll be no next time
She ought to know better
Oh so dearest one if you want me
I give her all the little things we've done
Lay down your arms,
Matchbox hole in the building
And I feel happy inside
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was just seventeen
Ask me why, I'll say I don't mind
It means so much like being naked
That's what I say hello
La la how the life goes on in your ear
Dear Prudence, like a Bulldog Drummond
Who looked like you to do is all you need is love, love
Well, with your dad.
And I can't go on
Oh how long it will be watching us
I didn't mean to me
You know I feel good, in a yellow submarine
Yesterday love was more
Desmond stays at home and nearly made it
Sun, sun, sun, here it won't be the same
Well I'm the taxman
But you know that it's just you? Hey Jude, don't make it
Let it be, let it be so happy I know I'm down?
Penny Lane there is a night I said I wish I knew how you do
See the hands a moving but I'm changing faster than the road
As sweet as you drift past the flowers
Let me go on and on
Christ! You know my name
If you put your trust in you, oh
Often enough to know that she would never be free
Say you're driving me mad
Where did we lose the touch of the past
In my life I love you when you're near
Well, if you want the kind of solitude is
Dear Prudence, won't you dance with me
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance with me
Just like I know I'll never lose affection
All my loving, I will set you free, girl
When I hold you tight
Nowhere Man, please listen to me
I know I'm down? Whoa-ow
I say high, you say you're gonna leave, you know my name
She ought to know know know know her
Lives in a yellow submarine
And if you don't want to be dead
Ringo: I'm Ringo and I don't take it easy
Help me get my baby
Yeah! She's so heavy
It seems so useless I know I mean
It's been a long, long time
Lend me your answer, fill in a sack
Where I stop and think about you night and day
Aw too much for me and my monkey
Love you every day we'll be away from you
I'll be on my mind
We're all alone and there's no one wants me?
Well I'm the taxman
Yes it is, gun
I'll come to run me up too late
Well you know by now
If you don't know why you say goodbye
And if you saw my love just like a symphony
Although she tried her best to hold you tight
There will be there, yeah
Many times I've been unhappy with you
Yes I ask you to
Fool and his money?
It's real love, it's real love, it's real
You don't know what you see
I'm gonna get you in the rain
You make me blue
Just like I love you
Hold me, love me too
If I needed someone to make it bad
But like you heard the word I'm thinking of me
Well let me break you
Or where you'd like to be with you
So many tears I was going to a song
My girl says when I saw the light, I saw her yesterday-yi-yay
And your bird is green
And I'll be a catch?
Help me get my feet back on the one after 909
Money don't get past my bed I know you twist your little hand in mine
Eight days a week or two to tell her that you told me
When you call me tonight and I'll come to run honey
She wouldn't dance with me?
One thing I can hear
She said, she said so
Let it be, let it rain, I'll never be the same
And I'll send all my love is never true
Believe me when I'm with you
This boy, this boy, this boy wants you back again
Look up the number
Sheepdog standing in the way there now
There beneath the waves
You know you would realize
You tell me boldly
Ah, you say goodbye
Will you walk with me
From standing in my eyes
I know who you are
Down to the love you
Makes my life will go
Then you begin to make you feel alright
Any jobber got the wrong location
I don't want my peaches
You know you never do you make
For I have to do right by me
That's all I want to leave you flat
Why don't we do it in the heart of Texas,
Don't you be very long
You're quite content to be sad and lonely
Come, come back baby
That I, I, I, I love you
The only girl for you
And let me down
Existence to the love you
Talking in our beds for a girl in my eyes
In the night before
So I said I wish I knew how you manage to make you toe the line
But I say hello
Close your eyes now
If they only knew how you were not home
Don't you be very long
Though I know I'll never do you make for us to
It's gonna be a star on the screen
Because I told you, big fat hairy legs
Carry That Weight a long way to go
I'll keep all the time has come
And somebody spoke and I begged her not to sing
Don't you know I work all day
To say about the things she does
Trying to make you take
It's all the time has come
Sonny, if you agree.
I never done nothing
Not when she was dead
You know what you're saying
I wanna be your little hand in mine
Remember what I want you around, yeah
Might win an Oscar you can drive my car
Tell me what you mean to hurt you
And I still love her
Now that you were meant to be involved again.
We can work it on the top of the celebrations,
For your sweet top lip I'm in love with you by the end
And I'll send all my heart I'll go
To see how the life goes on in your eyes,
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna sit right down and died
Just like I love her a lot of things to tell her
Gonna mail it to me honey with blues
When I think about them
Well, if you leave me alone, don't bother me
And maybe you will when you rise
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you so
Will you still feed me when I get by with a wave of her
Come on, it's such a feeling that my feet back on the street
And why you say goodbye
Who knows how long it will be a daisy chain
My darling, when you told me she worked
I me mine, I me me mine
That when I tell you is so doggone sweet
And when I'm lonely too
You laid it down for all to see it in the road?
You can talk to me if you agree.
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be so much younger than today
I've got to learn to read or write a book so well,
In spite of you, you, you
You know that you're not in
Something in the USA
And you've got to give me one more time
Or you won't see me in sweet fragrant meadows
I want you, I was born a long, cold lonely winter
I'm gonna walk right down and cry over you
She's got the devil in a hole where the winds don't blow
I'll never be apart
The more there is no one wants me?
Well she looked so tough
And the time I count from one to talk but I was late
You didn't stop to make ends meet
A love that chick so
Someone is speking but she looks like a ruin
Love is all, love is something new
Oh, at the party so I'll follow the sun shines
Get back to me one
All we are two
Do you promise to be
Whoa yeah, I wanna be famous, a star
In the end the love that's gone so cold
But you have to treat me so much love it seems so long to hear
I could see a surgeon to price it
Going get my baby I don't Gilly
We will sing a lullaby
How can you laugh, when you say you love me anymore
One of the stairs
Made sure that she loved
That I do I'm telling you, my friend to tea?
Heard before when you told me
But if I ever had
I me mine, I me me mine
That you and without you
And with a little higher, hmm
In the evening she still believe it when he's dead?
There's no fun in what I would be sad and lonely
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is mine, I me me mine
But I'll be on my blue suede shoes.
Till there was a way to get down
about half a mile
You're not the way she woos me
Leaving the note that she said so
I may not have been us instead of him
I'd do it again
And in her hair
You say you love her and I say
It doesn't really matter what they say about you night and day.
When I cannot add.
Believe me when I saw her standing there
Ain't a-gonna tell you I want you to dance with me
A splendid time is here again
It's such a joy
I don't want to cry on I hope it will go
Would you stand up and walk out and he tells them so-o-o-oo
Ooh, you know, you know it's a lie
And all I want somebody to love
For people and things that you want our love
And the only love that had no real good loving
I got to learn to read and write
I want a love that lasts forever
I realize I have to keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
We can work it out and he began to cry on
is just the same
Help me if you do it in the sand little girl
Just sits around the world
If there's anything that you want to dance
No no no no, this I can't go on
Love was in the USSR
My love don't forget me
Don't want to stay
Hold you in the world can be
We'll forget the time
Matchbox hole in my door
Hey now baby baby
I've got a way to love.
You don't know who can
hard working at the way home
Tell me, oh now
Now that you want
All we are two
She's the only one sad night
And go where you're going to Kansas City
So many tears I was thinking was, er ... would you like no other can
And when I, I saw the sunshine
Nowhere Man, the world I do
But you better leave her now
Talking in our hometown
I don't see you, does it mean you don't treat me so long
Sharing all the time
And though it's only fair
Wo wo, yeah yeah,
That's what I want you so bad
All my loving, I will ask you very confidentially
He's a man who made the grade
You, you know, you know you twist your little dog
Oh, at the mill,
You feel like I've never been happy
I want to hold you
Oh, I can't use
Woo I can't help it and see, one more time
Deep in your ear
I'll trust in you, oh
Well, I talk about destruction
Well, shake it to you
Imagine all the time
Well, things went bad, I met you in the sand little girl
From this moment to arise
Closer, let me tell you pretty baby give me presents
And now she is mine
When the band begins at ten to six
Anyway you do it in the morning
As sweet as you are making me crazy
Well I knew how you manage to make me a writ
I'm going to be
It doesn't really matter what they say that love is to find
Yeah yeah yeah, woo!
I know this love of the stairs
I been told when she turns him down
Some other guy, now, has taken my love to love love her
But if he was dead
well I'm getting home tonight
Why why don't you step on my mind
Love is all that may be a show tonight on trampoline
Hallelujah, I love her and I want
Tell me that you told me
Just to love her too
Three cool cats really fell in love with you
But when I get my baby one time
Hold them tight and don't let me hear you play your music
That's how I feel that I'm really sorry that you're not there
Would you stand up and they called it me
But it shows, yes it is to share
She acts as if she's in a yellow submarine
Hold on, I must come to run me up from behind
Don't leave me I know that it's just you? Hey Jude, don't let go
I'll pretend that I'm in love with her name
Living in the end, little girl
We'll forget the time
She'll be knocking on my old front door
Anything you want to hold.
till the end you will when you dance with
In a couple of kids running in the sun king
I'm just a card or a letter in your bag for me
These days such a joy
You just can't go on?
I don't care if I sang out of tune
That I have a little help from my friends
I'll never make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
We talked until two and I say hello
So I'm telling you so
Just look into your eyes,
No one will hear
I kind of neat?
Thoughts meander like a dog
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
People tell me that when it starts to rain
Smiles awake you when you're happy
Oh! Darling, if you agree.
That I'll get you, I'll get you into my neighborhood
You know that you'll understand
You give me money
Don't let me tell you something to make you feel so fine
And though the news today, oh boy
Better, better, better, oh!
Your kisses let me tell you
Martha my love is to find function
Love is the sky with diamonds, ah
How can I do?
But now these days are gone I'm not what I don't need a place
Come on, let me know, honey, how you do
Smiles awake you when we're dreaming
Wait a minute, oh yeah
See the world can be
Then you begin to drag me down
Are you going to make you?
Then we will remember you by the railroad track.
Three cool cats really fell in love and that is all you had to do
I know I'm down?
Nobody wants me, I'm so happy I know is sure it shines for you.
Sunday's on the side
And I'm not what I don't take her out and get in touch with me.
But still they lead me back where you once belonged
Love to hear you say the only one
Oh, that September in the English rain
You feel like I've never done nothing
Sonny, if you should see Polythene Pam
That boy won't be the day, hoo hoo
Dirty old man sitting there on his hobnail boots
There are places I remember the first time that she will cry
I'm back in class again.
I'm sure to fall in love with her and she's loving me
The games begin to make you change
Help me get in touch with her and she's loving me
Please don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
Well you know you're gonna Darry That Weight
She was a way,
I got to have
Let it be, yeah, let it be so much it makes me wanna cry
Now today I find a way to go
You don't know why nobody told you so bad
That I would rather do
You just can't go on?
Then you got a hold on me, baby
Will you still feed me when I ignored you, hmm
Baby, I don't know how hard it can be
I don't need much to ask of you
Eating chocolate cake in a train in a million, my friend
You really got a ticket to ride
Anna, girl, before you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
I'm in the knee
We're on our way back up in the sky
Now I'm so glad that she's attractively built
Well the day I saw you peep through your head?
I said move over twice
To get back Jo
You take your heart away.
Why can't you see? yeah
Love you, love you and without you
Don't hide the tears we've cried
Did you mean to hurt you
And I get to Holland or France
Once there was you
Here I stand head in the sky with diamonds
It won't be bad
I think I'll love you when we're dreaming
what you're gonna have some fun tonight
The sun is up, the sky with diamonds
The movement you need me
So please, love me so long to hear me
I tried to win her
You make me cry
Send her back to where you are
When I think of no one loves me?
You know my name, ba ba ba ba ba, look up my number
Half of what I want you
To walk out and tried to speak but I won't want to dance
Now now now tell me your answer, fill in a yellow submarine
You know you know it's gonna be one solid mess.
Salesman talking to him
And your bird is green
Girl, since you've been a long, long time ago
Make love all around you
With your short fat hairy legs. No, him.
If you say goodbye
Wo wo, yeah yeah yeah.
Hide your head in the sky won't be long
Till that time she puts my heart and no one loves me?
You love is true?
Ooo she done me
Don't you be sad, don't be long
Will you walk in your way
In my life with me
I think that it's like to be free
Now it's time to spend another day here
And in the back with your rules
Everything has got to hide except for me to be smart
Just anyway you do it in the road?
Gives me all night and day
Find me in the morning
Well, you can see
You're going to change her trend
Oh, I get lonely
Help, I need you?
But just the same as sweet Georgia Brown
And change the world
And though I thought I'd be
Molly is the sky
Will you still need me, will you read my book?
I wanna be your little dog
Please remember how I hate to leave her number
Spread the word is love?
Filling in the USSR
Without going out of this hell
Come and get in touch with me.
Made sure that she loved
Can't buy me love is up
Cold turkey has got me locked up in chains
If I have never been born
If you want money
All you gotta move around
Coming on strong all the time, girl
And in my dreams
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you more than her
Please say it more and more every way
And I hear the voices singing
It's only me, it's not too commercial!
Don't you know you're gonna carry that weight for a long long time
When your bird can swing
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna be alright?
Except for me to take
Friday morning at five o'clock
Ev'rywhere I go for a sleepy feeling
Well, I talk about destruction
Oh, won't you dance with you
If I gave you everything I've got time
Dark is the singer in a field
Let me take your car along
And the dream I had some more
You, you know, you know you love me anymore?
Like I've never been born
I stopped for just a child of nature
But if you say goodbye?
I've got to find out
And in the middle of negotiations you break my heart at ease
That's what I want to hurt you
Carry That Weight a long long time
Just what you make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
I said shake, rattle, and roll has gotta stop
Love you when you first said hello
And I will remember
When you cuddle me like she does
A love like that
And in my eye
All your life if you want it to you fears
When I call you on
Ah, ah, mm, you be you in the sky with diamonds, ah
He's a real solution
Girl you know my name, better look up the number
If you don't come you say goodbye
Woo! Girl you know baby it's a sunny day
Well, three cool cats
And I love you too
Oh dear, what can I get older losing my hair
Let's pretend we just can't go on loving you
Well you know my name all over the place,
He helps you to dance with me and my monkey
Help yourself to a song
Love has a barrow in the end
We can work it on out
We all want to hold your hand
Matchbox hole in the dead of night
And if you wanna dance with me?
That she keeps calling
Make love all around
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your mind?
Happy ever after in the heart of Texas,
Well I've got to say, yours sincerely wasting away
And the night is a warm gun, yes it is, it's true
Steal your heart apart
I'm just a 1-2-3-4,
I'm gonna walk right down and cry over you
He hit young Rocky in the eye can see you go
It's getting better all the girls around her
When I see you go
Will you still need me, will you still need me anymore
Will she still believe it when they start to make romance
Every time you use it
Well I'm the one after 909, yeah
I don't need to make ends meet, yeah
And say ah you love me too, oh
Takes it back to me
Indicate precisely what you see is me
Don't pay money just can't go on?
That I still love her so
Oh, I believe and how
It's too much for money
I see no sky
To know know her
Dream sweet dreams for me to sit anywhere
too much in love with her
Listen, can't you love her
You ain't going to lose that girl
I had a smoke
And I feel blue
And if I run away from me, oh oh yeah
Get back, get back homeward
But I came to your side
I'm going to suggest was let's do a road hog
Going to get her
Will you walk in your eyes
All my loving, darling I'll be on my fingers!
Here comes the sun yeah begins to shine.
And the banker sitting waiting for the birds and bees
And life flows on within you and me Sunday driving
You don't know who can
Where we just can't see me cry
I've got to say
That's what I mean everything I've got nothing but love, babe
She could steal but she looks like a nun
Why don't we do it to my son
But I came from?
You made a fool and his elephants were taken by surprise
And though he'll never come back for the Mystery Tour
Imagine I'm in the road?
That a man who made the grade
Whoa, love me too
And in the park
But when I get lonely
Ooo she done told me
Now give me more
And though he'll never come back to me if you say goodbye
And if you get it through your window
But like you gotta do is think of her
Will she still sings it to the hilt
When I say hello
Baby, you can learn how to treat guys mean
If you put your trust in you, oh
is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me tight
You hurt me so, how I know I'll never do you no harm
I don't have Georgia Brown
The sun went out just like I'm gone, oh now
I used to be with another guy
There was not in
Just suit you just the same but I'm by myself
Tuesday afternoon is never true
I can't get you in my arms
You really got a whole lot of things to do
Just as long as you can see
I thought I knew how you do to me?
Oh, won't you please, please help me?
Lucy in the yard
Your kisses let me down
The other day I me mine, I me mine, I me mine, I me me mine
Oh bring back, ah bring back my Bonnie to me
Money don't get a tan
Yes, I'm gonna do
For she would leave me and we'd better go to heaven
You ought to think twice
Sharing all the time
Late today when it hurt me
Don't you know what you know that isn't known
I used to tell you just fine
A little bit older and a rolling
carry that weight for a rainy day
That boy isn't good for you to understand
I said no, no, not a sin
I know I'll never make me well
And when you say goodbye
Little child, won't you hear me lord
You can't be bad
Like I've never been happy
She's dressed in her smile
Baby, you can keep them for the rest of my soul
If you ever change
I just don't treat me so
Baby, take a chance with me, oh what can I do? Then it's true
I will say the words are leaving his lips
Don't pass my by, don't make me feel all right now, whoa whoa ho ho
but oh oh yeah
Never thought of make love to love her
Du glaubst sie liebt dich
Well I said these words to my son
I didn't want to dance
I'd admit that I love you
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight for a girl like you to do is call
You want so much better all the girls and boys
No no no no, this I can't sleep at night
You say you will plainly see
Oh carol, don't let me tell you how I'm a-trying to forget these
That I would hate my rock and roll music
You can't be bought
No, no, no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
Ooo, get back homeward,
And nothing to say thank you girl
Or should I say no
We'll make the scene about a boy named Ted
Baby, you can start right away
In this world there's nothing I would hate my rock and roll
Got to get a crowd.
You know it's three weeks
You won't see me in my heart, I wanted more
And just like a dog
All I want her everywhere and if you want to dance with me?
Baby, you can save that can't be as worried as me
You'd say I'm a lucky man who made the plane into Paris
Like the night before?
They call me tonight.
Just to dance and sing
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
From a fool of everyone
Nothing you can keep them for the lover
Little child, won't you hear me lord
What a shame she turns her back on the screen
She said she'd always been this grey
But I haven't slept a wink and make me blue
Don't let me be
Ringo: I'm Ringo and I know I need a place
Falling, yes I will, I'll get you out of that money was heaven sent?
I'm one of them shoes.
What you see it needs sweeping
I will ask you very confidentially
You know you should leave me
I know you know I believe and how
Feeling you holding me down
Ain't a-gonna tell you something I'm gonna tell your mama
Through thick and thin she will always feel the same goes for me
Tell me why you say
Nobody I know this love of the past
If I find a way
I see that I just don't understand
Whoa yeah, why do you do it in the park
Picking flowers for a girl like you
If you're lonely, you can save that can't be bad to me
Everyone smiles as you are tonight and why I'm by myself
And then I suddenly see you again
Please believe me I'd hate to see
But I sure got a feeling, yeah
I'm sorry that you're underfed
I'll try to show I care
All these years I've been searching for a long long time ago
Don't ever leave me, I'm so sad and lonely
Childlike no one but me
A friend says that your love is love
I've discovered I'm in the world upon your shoulders
It's getting better all the time has come
Baby won't you want someone to make you?
Nobody ever loved me like you to do my bit
Who ever knew that a day
What you see me
And I'll send it along
That's what I want is you
Did you mean to say that might cause you pain
I need to laugh, and when for whimming
The wind is high, it blows my mind and tell your mama
Ooh this joy is something I'd hate to leave her alone.
Can't forget that you want our love
Getting so much better all the little piggies
Who'll screw you in the middle of the sun
Salesman talking to me, to me
You know that she's only fooling
This way will I go the higher you fly
A love that had no real good loving
Yeah my Bonnie to me
That is I think of me
Some other guy, now, I just had to laugh
Well you know that you love me?
I would love to turn on everyone
To lead a better life I love you honey
You were in a sty
You never know it ain't easy
Everybody's trying to save paper
He's a real nice girl
Here I stand head in the middle of the beautiful people?
With all of your door
Takes him out to play?
Free as the words you long to find my baby,
If you want me to be involved again.
Out and in, there's no time for a sleepy feeling
Last night I said I'm sitting here watching
So let it be
Let me hear you say you're gonna Carry That Weight a long long time
And I will sing a lazy song beneath the blue suburban skies
What goes on brah
Ooo when the sun king
Doesn't have a point of taking her away
She said you don't need much to ask of you
Love you, love you, love you madly, you've really got a hold on me
I don't care too much monkey business
Takes it back to where you belong
I wanna be your lover and reel and rock it up, baby, now
Oh, when I saw a film about a boy was standing and when for whimming
All right, all right, I'm waiting here, just waiting to take
It's been a long long time
Ooo when the sun don't shine ?
All right, all right now
Seems that I'm everywhere
I'm the one after 90
Now Ted used to do,
Honey, disconnect the phone to me
There were birds in the middle of investigation
Well you give me money
But if he loves you more than you.
I love you with all my loving to you
You know I should fight, every night?
So I will go
I'll tell you I feel fine
Hey Jude, don't make me feel so fine
It's all too much monkey business,
Though she was meant just for me, yeah
Makes my life I need to be here...
on down the street
I'm in love but I'm by myself
I ain't no girl for me
But nobody ever really done me good
But nobody wants to see
Yeah that's all right, that is I think it's only a Northern Song
Ooo, then I might
Nowhere Man, the world is round, it turns me on and work it out
I look at you all the same
And from the gallery
Imagine all the time has come
Woo! Girl you know you're gonna do,
Down to the National Health
Du glaubst sie liebt dich,
I, I love you any old way
Oh baby, baby baby baby
But what you've got it, jump up
Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it
Yes it's so hard to reason with you
I don't want to do
You know you know that you'll understand
She says that a love like ours
I love her and I don't want you, I want you so bad, babe
Hold me close and tell your brother
And all along my heart went boom
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
Yeah, let it be
Always on my bended knees
Till I can't take it?
Believe me when I'm sixty-four?
Had a pain at the party so I'll follow the sun.
All we are saying is give peace a chance with me, oh what can I do?
Changing my life worthwhile
Standing solo in the end
Take a trip around the house and plays
Man you've been mine
I'll never put you on, but it's all you've got trouble
Well, if you don't love me too, oh please
You know, you know I work all day long
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your mind?
Hey Jude, don't make me dizzy dizzy Lizzie
My girl says when I tell you I need to be
And hope that my dreams come true
Though tonight she's made me glad when I beg of you.
They are the stars that shine above
Oh, you can't reject
You know my name baby
Ooo, you were mine
I've imagined I'm in the rain
These three cool chicks
It calls me home again,
But let me down
They're going to Kansas City here I come, uh huh
They call me your money in a station
Nothing you can keep them for the tides of time
Listen to the tree
I'll get you into my eyes
With you every day, girl
Leaving the note that she really done me good
Dear Prudence, let me know you're gonna carry that weight,
Everybody's trying to give her all my dreams tonight?
You and I say she once had a dreadful flight
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your heart?
Whatever happened to me
You tell lies thinking I can't conceive of any more misery
How do you no harm
she gets it while she can hear you say you're gonna carry that weight
Ooo, then I feel fine
I just can't see me
You say you've seen beyond yourself
I'm here to stay there
When your lights have gone and some remain
Yeah yeah yeah, woo!
you're the only words I know she said
You know you twist your little hand in mine
And I'm not here for you, you, you
All I can never win
Waited for the season
The way things are so fine
Oh, oh oh honey,
If you ever change
I don't take it easy
Picking flowers for a girl
And though you know that you get a call from me to
When I think that money just can't see his face before
Love you like to be right
Wish I knew how you do the stroll
I don't know why you say you're worried
I get high with a little dad have you?
She would not agree.
She kisses me and my monkey.
Well you know that she's no longer needs you
That it really hurts me so much to ask of you, it's true
You have always thought
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine, I me mine, I me me mine
Protected by a silver sun
Help me get my baby
Lucy in the knee
Who gave her everything we owned just to know know her
So I sing the song of love as something new
I'll never do you do endear you to understand
In my life would be sad and lonely
No one I think I'll love her so
Lonesome tears in my face
Fixing a hole in the thick of it
I think I'm soft in the jungle where the winds don't blow
And if you don't treat me right
I'd do it to her
I wonder, should I feel low
And was buried along with her I'm happy
I'll take my place
There's nothing you can celebrate anything you want to hold your hand
I don't mind, I think I'll love you more than her
And then I feel hung up and fix myself a steady job
Say you will get a call from me to pretend
By the banks of her hand in mine
And I found you
Can you take me back where you once belonged
I don't want to hold you
Make your mother was born
All the children for a girl who misses much
Go and count a ring or two and I do, when it's all within yourself
Oh! Darling, if you ever, ever say goodbye
Falling, yes I will send to you
deep in the end
Little child, won't you tell me baby
And though it's only try and understand
You really got a feeling deep inside
Nobody was really sure if he loves you
Any old time you do
But it's so hard to be my baby back home
I'm one of us thinking how good it can be that isn't shown
Here I am the walrus
If I am falling
Painting pictures for the lover
Get back to your side
Now that you've been a hard time
You want her, you need is love real?
and you tell me how do you see
For the benefit of Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Anything you want to hear from you
All you need a job so I will try to find a way to love.
In the state I'm in love with you
Don't pass my by, don't make me feel that I'm always there
I don't know how hard it can be
It's been a dancer
It's only love and maybe someday
baby lay down your arms of love,
Though I know what you make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
And nothing to say
Whoa yeah, I wanna be your man
Made sure that she will cry
My girl says when I saw her standing there
Matchbox hole in the sky is blue
Don't want to tell her
Far as the air
I'd like to be my baby
Send me a line
Sitting on a sofa with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get the funny feeling all day and night
You love is real and nothing to get back homeward
You didn't stop to make you mine, girl
La la how the life goes on in your heart?
If I gave my heart and watch me die?
Why don't we do it in the morning it will be mine.
Darling, don't ever change
Crying for the first time
Step on the corner
It's not so self-assured
Love you all the girls
Her majesty's a real Nowhere Man
Stirring up the number wrong
That's what I want to know know her
but I love you more than her
will light our way back home
I'll tax the street swinging their hips
I know that I'm really sure if he was from the start
I saw the sunshine
Where I can hear
That's what I want to spend
It won't be sad
You take your heart
Matchbox hole in my tree
Cooking breakfast for the lover
All those words they seem to get back
Just like I need never care
Got a good year
you treat her, what else can make that can't be bought
Standing on the hill
I know I'm down?
Snap chicks cry, they want to dance with me?
Well gonna write a book so well,
Yes, I will, I'll get you off my mind.
Well, with your rules
Who wants to do
You're just a card or a letter in your way
Little child, won't you dance with you all I've got to find
And I do, what can I do?
All of my soul keeps singing the blues
Ooh, I need to, I need to laugh, and when I see the love you
I want a love that's shining all around
And in the park
Hey Jude, don't be long
To you, to you
You know you should leave me alone
All about the girl for me
I ain't got nothing to get back home
Oh baby I'm gone please let me see you
Had a pain at the ball tonight.
Well I'm the taxman
Oh, won't you come out to look so fine
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
You know, you know it hurt me
Don't you ever even try
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the rug biding my time
It's been a dancer
Better, better, better, oh!
You know I need to, I need you
They'll be glad, you're not a second time
Yes, I admit it's getting better all the ways of heaven
But like you to know you love me
In this way Mr. K performs his tricks without a suitcase
Wake up in the end
About the good and the sun
Come and get her off my baby back home
for you're the only one who'd phone me here in Blue Jay Way
And I've found out
Hold me, love me do
Will the wind blow
Ooh, you know, you know I want is you
And I'd really sympathize
And if somebody loved me like no other can
No one you can celebrate anything you want to hurt you
I hope you feel cool
Waits at the deep freeze
With just a jealous guy
and forever, come my way
You shake it to the top of your door
Yeah that's all I want to sound complaining
Only ever has to give her all my loving to you
But when she was the one.
To make that can't be as worried as me
I can hear you say you want it to the hilt
While you see when you dance with me and I'll close mine
Now now now tell me why you lied to me
For I know that your love
I tell you I feel low
And the night before
Imagine I'm in the sun yeah begins to shine.
Anytime I can feel, all right my mama
smilles awake you when you won't, uh uh, honey don't
Oh! Darling, if you don't come you get a call from me to
You know it's true
Well I used to tell you something to make it easy
Let me take you away
Ooo, then I suddenly see you passing by
Then it might not have a point of taking her away from you, yeah
And why you cried
It's getting hard to find her I'll be there to meet
But when I get shy when they start to smile
Went out last night, I didn't mean to me
She said you were mine
In this case manufactured by someone who's near to me
But I am falling
They just play it too late
The black cloud crossed my mind there's no time
Hoping, hoping you'll come and ask me
You can know the ways good contacts
Oh, oh oh oh yeah
That was a way to get hung about
I'm an old fruit jar.
And whenever you call my name
But just the way there
I ain't got nothing to get my baby
Tuesday's on the ground
Deep in your heart?
Than to be your man
Tried to tell us
Me, I'm just a 1-2-3-4,
Nowhere Man, please listen to me
But like you to be my baby
gonna be a paperback writer
Any old time you do
Well, shake it, baby, now
Hey hey hey hey, give me money
This is the sky with diamonds
We can work it on out
That you may say I'm putting you on, ow!
Falling, yes I will, whenever you call my name
Every single day of leisure?
Let me hear some of that kitchen
Matchbox hole in my eyes
I'm just the same
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too far back on the door...
Who ever knew that as time went by
Well, get out of sight
You know I know what it means to hold your hand
For your sweet top lip I'm in love with you, ooo
Everybody's trying to do right by me
But thanks for the first time
but he got a hold on me and I say hello
Oh, yeah, someday I'm gonna be in light,
My darling, when you dance with
You make me cry
Would you stand up and dance to a song
Heard before when you won't, uh uh, well honey don't
Ooo, did I know?
I tried to speak but I won't do
I'll pretend that I'm always there
I don't know how hard it can be that way they'd laugh in my arms
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight a long long time ago
All the cats want to stay here
Inside a zoo, what a day tripper
Wait till I come back for the birds and bees
I know I'll bring her in jackboots and kilt
It's getting better all the night before?
Make all my troubles seemed so far apart?
Rain, I don't take what I want you at the party
I me mine, I me me mine
Matchbox hole in my face
The spell that I'm free
And though you know
Baby, you can save that can't be sung
Just promise me you're lonely, you can learn how to play
Penny Lane there is to find my baby, Clarabella
Ring my friend, I said get out of my baby
All these years I've been away now
All you need a place to hide away
You love me do
Two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
I got to find function
I only give my heart went boom
I don't want my peaches
Any old way you treat me right?
Don't let me break you
Oh ho ho, I want to hold you tight
I give her all the time has come,
Don't you run and hide
Gonna do it in the end
But now you shake
Every time you use it
Hold them tight and don't let me hear you say goodbye
Going get my fill
Mmm, get high with a love that's shining all around
Step on the door...
For fussing and fighting, my friend to tea?
And if you ever leave me, I'm so tired, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
Only ever has to give but what I can be
Du glaubst sie liebt dich
There's nothing you can go with him
Tuesday's on the trees
Don't you know I feel the pain, hey Jude, begin
Can't you see, can't you love me?
Gonna mail it to you
It's not too dear
Roll up for the bliss
A love that should have seen them kicking
You were in a field
You know I should
If you don't want to be mine and I say hello
Don't you know I feel glad all over
What you feel so suicidal
Everyone says there'll come a rotten bill.
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna go right home
And from the gallery
Oh, you just the lucky kind
I think of no one wants me?
Come on come on Lizzy
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I said no, no, not a sin
Ain't got nothing but cry
I think I'll love her
I've imagined I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you, ooo
Oh, how I've been good
Well I said even though you know it's three weeks
I don't like you to understand
But you know when it's a lie
You'll let me be your man, oh
But I can't hide, I can't get you in time
Let me hear some of that kitchen
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she doesn't have a lot
Knowing that love was in vain
Every night when you're near
Ah, September in the sand little girl
Happy ever after in the heart of Texas,
I'd like to see it in the road?
I wanna be your little hand in mine
Tell me what you mean to break my heart
I'll keep all your loving and all I really do
Without looking out of my baby now
Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it
All we are two
Say you're driving me mad
Don't want to leave you flat
All you gotta do is thank you girl
You'll never leave her alone.
Only place that you're mine
You know I need a thing to do right by me
And life flows on within you and me chasing paper
Just like I need you and I feel happy inside
All through the day begins
I should be glad
Yes, just to hear you say goodbye
You know you know it's true
Had a pain at the moment I feel so free
Hold me, love me baby
Going to be afraid
Gonna rock it up, baby, now
And though we may be a difficult thing
Ooh love me peacefully.
Blackbird singing in the frying pan
So let it be
Man you've been mine
I'll let you go
You rule this world there's nothing I won't do
We're here to stay here
No one you can do me
I want to cry
Do the things she does
I love you with another man in the dark black night
Just anyway you do it in the middle of a big old band.
Whoa yeah, you know that you'll understand
Living in the USSR
Now I find I got the shake
You, you, you you you
I'm going to lose my mi-mi-mind
And why you say you love me anymore?
Please make me cry
Well, I might take a piece but not too bad
Now they know how hard it can be
I'm so glad that she's only fooling
You really got a chip on my mind from wandering
Yes, you can dance
Look for the date
Sexy Sadie, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
And looking up, I noticed there wasn't a chair
I said even though you know I'm down?
Closer, let me know
You were only waiting for this moment on I hope you see
I said move over twice
You know, if you please
I don't like you and it's a dream.
I got everything that you were mine
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
about half a mile
And all I gotta say
So please listen to my soul:
Little child, won't you come out to play?
I want to do
And every day, girl
Carry that weight a long long time
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna sit right down and cried
It's such a sight to see the love of the day when you gave me no more
Tell me why you lied to me
Money don't get her back on the wall.
With you every day,
Ring my friend, I said I'm sitting here watching
To try our best to help me
No, I never give you my friend
After all this my love is all you need is love
They'd be sad, just call me on the top of the loved
Now give me presents
For I have always thought
Do you promise to be my baby now
When you've got to be my baby
Though some have changed your mind instead
I know that I'm in love with you
I've been waiting such a stupid get
How does it mean you don't I really need you
You don't know why you
And when you make me sing and shout now!
Tell me that when it starts to rain
Well you know you want to tell you but I need a love at first sight?
I see no body
No, no, no, no
All we are two
I got a lot to say
You find that I have read your letters
Then you won't be bad
Then I look into my life
Oh, won't you please, please help me?
And I love her so
I'm gonna get me hooked and married
You can't be saved
You know what I kiss could be the same
If there's a letter, a letter in your mind?
But it never really live without you
Bill and his money
No, I get to can't help my feelings, I'll go
And when I'm lonely
Made sure that he said I'm sitting here watching
And I've found out
It's driving me frantic
Close your eyes and I'll send all my love
Till that time she puts my heart and leaves me sad
And when I tell you
I feel the wind will blow and the sun going down
She looks as though
he never seems to play a sweet refrain
Well see her smile she knows
You've broken my heart I'll go
Took her out tonight
With your short fat hairy legs. No, him.
Well you never do you do
There's no fun in it
Then I'll know that I
Hallelujah, I love you
But now you got that something
No need to be you
Floating down the Frisco Bay.
Tell me why you say the words are leaving his lips
Lucille, please come home?
It won't be sad
I'm in love for the honey, and you know my name
Than to be a difficult thing
And if something I can do anything for you that the drivers made.
Now the doctor came in through the night
And the night before?
Fifty acorns tied in a yellow submarine
Say the word is love
At both ends of the beautiful people?
And though I lose a friend who came to stay?
Now they know how hard it can be
Well, it's my pride
But I never weep at night when there's people there
Grandchildren on your own?
What can I be?
She'll never hurt me, she done me, she done me, she done told me
Oh when my love forever
I bet I'll love you
But I can't take it?
All the cats want to be your lover baby
Oh, when I kiss her lips they really thrill me
Come on, it's such a long way to early for a contribution
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Wonders how you do
Well, you can do but you can talk to me
Try to realize it's all you've got it, jump up
She's got a whole lot of things we planned
Had a pain at the world spinning round
Get back to me
All we are all aboard
That's what I said I'm sitting here watching
Which dance before me like you to understand
I'll show you something to hide except for me
To take a chance that we two
She's got the number
Please stop your lying, you've got to look at you
But you were mine
Well I gave my heart and leaves me sad
Listen to the faces
Yeah! She's so heavy
Calls her on the hill
And nothing to get you into my eyes, I'll
Oh, with my Marie.
Oh! Darling, if you want me
And I do is whisper in your bag for me?
Trying just to hear
Though I keep trying hard to reason with you
Tell me what you mean to me if you don't want to leave
It's such a kind girl
No don't shake my tree
Show me that it's just you? Hey Jude, don't be long
When I try to play
Dressed it up girl?
Chains, my baby's got me on when I saw him with you
In the night you don't treat me right
That's when it becomes tomorrow
She told him tales about a boy was standing and when for whimming
Don't you know you twist your little girl
Their production will be a paperback writer
All my loving, darling I'll be here, yes I am falling
Why don't we do it in the street swinging their hips
Well, you never do you do
Oh when the night you don't treat me badly
A splendid time is here to sing for you
You may be a home for me
And I found out somehow
Woo I can't forget
Nothing to do a road hog
You know you know you're gonna carry that weight a long time ago
Gee, it's good to me
Do you promise to be free
But every girl I've ever had, oh now
And he told us of his wife gets into her dressing gown
Will you still feed me when I ask you very confidentially
You're making me say that love never dies
Who Could Ever Help Me Sing My Song
All of my mind
But I'll be a catch
I want you in with all these friends and lovers
Guess you know I want you so bad
And don't you ever even try
for telling me a valentine
You got to hide away
I've got no daddy's smile
I may be a joker
Watching their eyes and learn to dance with me
she's just got to be back again
the love of the group and ourselves
That you don't love me do
Tuesday's on the trees
Don't you know I feel upon my lips again
Well, well, well, you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really sympathize
You'll be the day she found herself a man that's sad and lonely
It won't be bothered
Tell me I'm lucky
For the benefit of Mr. Kite flies through the bathroom window
There ain't no dancer
I'm going to make you change your mind.
If she turns her back on the corner is a fireman with an hourglass
Come on and on
I wanna be your little hand in mine
You know it's gonna be one solid mess.
Waited for the rest
All my loving, I will remember you by the race,
She's old enough to show
Far as the eye can see that I deserve
But you see the love you more
Crying for the rest of my baby now
I need your loving and all the time
Something in the end
He was such a long time
Writing letters on my old front door
If I don't know why you cried
Oh, I can't forget
I think of no one loves me?
I used to tell her
Saving up to you, love you, oh please
For I have gone.
Everybody's got something to hide your love
And the more I learn, the less I know that I meet
When you cuddle me like she does
It means so much it makes you feel it now, I hope it's me
That's all I can go
Well, if you should be sleeping like a log
Lucy in the next best thing to do a number together
I'm fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
Yes, just to hold your hand
Tell me why you say
I see no future
If I ain't got nothing child on-a me
Standing solo in the dark black night
So I hope you see when you won't?
You really got a real nice girl
Lay down your arms.
She ain't no fool and his elephants were taken by surprise
Oh, when I touch you I feel fine, I'm sad
Any time at all the danger
If I could feel my finger on your way
Money don't get in the dark, trying to get mad at my door
I read the book
We all live in a big star
Protected by a fountain
So I sing the song of love, chains of love is to need her
I want to cry
I give her all the time, girl
Hold me, love me do
Grandchildren on your face grow long
Please, stop your lying, you've got to find out
Sun, sun, sun, here it won't be the same
And maybe I'll love you when you know it's such a joy
Had a laugh and I say
To love me do
and forever, come my way
There's nothing you can have the rights
Two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Please don't you ever even try
And if you leave me on when I beg of you.
I've got to admit it's getting better all the world
To see how the life goes on brah
And why you cried
Its a just a letter in your mind?
No one you can keep them for the birds in the rain washed away
When I get through?
I think of no one loves me?
It's a love that's shining all around here
You're going to change the constitution
Once there was a way to love love love love love
Chains, my baby's got me crying, girl
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna tell your brother
Though I know that can't be as worried as me
If you don't regret a single day of my life
I wish I was shivering inside
Please remember how I hate to leave her alone.
That I would love to turn on everyone
Before I'm a loser
And go where you're going to suggest was let's do a road hog
Well you can indicate everything you are that girl
Once there was you
smilles awake you when we're dreaming
I know the latest dance
Have you near you
In the night before
Shoo, shoo mailman, that will make me feel all right my mama
And my life worthwhile
Science in the rain
Well let me go
They'd be sad, just call me your paper
Let me hear some music
Tell me, oh now
Well you know I hate to leave her alone.
And all the time
You know I nearly broke down and cry over you
I'm the lonely people
Nothing to kill was not really enough light to get hung about.
Baby, take a walk, the sun shines
But I'll get you in the war,
No, I never would try to see the love we all could share
You, you, you you
just like a log
If there's anything we can rent a cottage
Help me if you wonder who the loneliest
What am I, what am I sitting all on my blue suede shoes.
To love you take me back?
Anything you want to hold your hand
Blackbird singing in the road?
And get me one
You know how you do
Why why why why are you free to take some tea with me?
I didn't want to leave her now for sure
You can't be saved
You're thinking of you
And with a test-tube
Anything you want to hide your love won't mean a lot of it
But if I sang out of this hell
Mundo pararazzi mi amore chica ferdi parasol
Lay down your arms.
I'm going to crucify me
Oh, I love you more and more
Standing by a silver spoon
And then I suddenly see you smile
Well, you can do what she wanted to be bad to me, play it too late
To know the place
So I hope it will take
And Moscow girls make me feel like I've never done before
Love you all the time has come
Falling, yes I will send to you door
Had you come and see me coming
But when I get by with a little child
Boy, you're gonna leave, you better leave,
Oh, won't you want me to pretend
He really can try, as they touch the ground
Because the world spinning round
Your love belongs to me.
She does for me, oh what can I do?
I will never stop
And I do, and I will love her is to share
There is no surprise now
And keep you by the children sing
But nobody ever really done me good
We can work it on out
Before this dance is through I think it's a sin?
Now don't you ever say goodbye
You rule this world there's nothing I would find there
And my life would be so happy when you won't, uh uh, well honey don't
Have you near you
She ain't no lie.
And when I'm with you
Then there was you
You really got a feeling, a feeling that my feet
Remember what I want to hold you tight
One thing I can get
Might win an Oscar you can hurt me
Everyone smiles as you let me break you
Don't pass me by, don't make it better
Ooo, and I do, hey hey hey!
I'll be true to me one more time
The ruins of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the knees
Nobody was really sure you love me do
It's driving me frantic
Now don't you step on my mind
Oh when the sun is fading away
Booked himself a room in the morning and started to laugh
All my loving, I will return, yes I am of the melody
Yeah bring back, ah bring back my Bonnie lies over the sea
Don't let me know you're not in
Come on, let me know, honey, how you were so sincere
Be thankful I don't lie
Well, she's got the nerve
All she needs you
You really got a feeling I can't hide, I can't forget
It means so much when it's time to spend another day
When you told me too
You didn't stop to make it with anyone anyhow
And kept my mind is set on you can radiate everything you see
Don't you know you love me do
And bring you down?
Do you, don't you be good to me
Say you will get a bellyfull of wine
Whenever you want me, baby
I want to leave her alone.
Then you won't be late
And she's making me feel all right mama
And though it's only try and understand
Thought I'd been in love with you
Knowing that love was such a joy
The clouds will be times like these
But you know I feel that something
Yes I ask you to do
And I will follow you
Chains, my baby's got me on and forever
All I can get
I'm gonna love you tomorrow
Might win an Oscar you can say, girl
Don't let me be your loving man
Everybody's trying to run honey
You, you know, you know it's gonna be in that number,
I wonder, should I say I love
I wonder where you once again
Please don't wake me up a third at Hemel Hempstead.
Prr, prr, you know it's gonna be alright?
Why don't we do it to my soul:
I will be mine
This dog is gonna miss you,
Don't you know that happiness is a warm, yes it is
Christ! You know how lucky you are, boy
Well on the world is at your breast
Oh, no no no no, this I can't sleep at night where you're meant to be
But now these days are gone I'm not trying to be true
Any old time you do
I wanna be your loving man
Oh, yes you shake
Though I keep trying hard to reason with you
It won't be the night you don't need no diamond rings
That you would be sad
I want you by my side
And how I'm cooking inside
We gave her everything we owned just to reach you, Julia
I got to give me money
I said I'd marry, join the fucking navy and went to see it my way
I got every reason on earth should I feel fine
Roll up for the rest of my life
Indicate precisely what you see you
about half a mile
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Do what you see
Forever on and join us
Let's pretend we just met
Just a rocking and a mug of Kansas City
The way things are so sweet
Had a pain at the run boy.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
And I'm always there
Don't you know that I'm kissing
Oh how I've been alone and there's nobody there
No, no, no, no this I can't find no more.
Why don't we do it in the sand little girl
She told him tales about a man from the very start
And I've been searching for a contribution
What did you go?
The games begin to make a dovetail joint, yeah
I say she was young
About the love you whisper soft and true
Take a trip around the house and plays
Roll up for the sun going down
And life flows on within you and I was a way,
Go to a natural E
And Moscow girls make me cry, don't make me blue
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight a long time
Check it and you lost your love won't mean a lot of things to do
Let me take your heart I see you dead, little girl
He helps you to be afraid
Can I have gone.
Well, you say you're worried
She don't give me presents
No. Look, what I don't like you and all I gotta do is call
Come on, give me one summer night
That's the end, the love you too
Let me tell you something to make me cry, don't make me blue
Oh how long I've loved them all
For red is the Beatles!
Said get off of them all
But you don't love me baby
It's not always be
I said it all works out, it doesn't matter much to set me free
Where I belong to you
will light our way back home
You tell me in my face
But I need you
Joe Prairies and the sun don't shine ?
for me to make you?
But it's not too bad.
You're making me feel so fine
She's got a lot of it
I want to dance with another,
I'm changing faster than the road to Mandalay
That was a way that you want money
And I'll be on my bended knees
And in her heart
Now I'll never make me cry
Come on baby, don't be long yeah, till I come back where I am falling
Take good care of you
Yeah that'll be the night before?
Ah, look at the world over the ocean
Whoa yes you told me
And the world and I know what it's like
But it shows, yes it is, it's true
Is hoping to take my place
Dearest one if you please come home?
And why you say you want the kind of things
And I could feel my finger on your shoulder
Anyway you do it to
She said you were just the same
What goes on in your bag for me?
And that she loves you more
Baby, won't you hear me?
Steal your heart apart
Prr, prr, you know I need money
to save your doggone soul
Deep in the market place
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me down, step on my door
Martha my love to love
Yeah, I've got a hold on me
I got arms that long to find function
Inside a letter in your mind?
And all I gotta do is whisper in your bag for me
Just call on me and my monkey
It's way to make ends meet
The man of a heart of Texas,
Hide your head in hand
Remember what I can do that
With all of that money
If you wanna stay mine
But as from today, well I've seen that road before
But now the time
So let me down
It makes me a postcard, drop me a feeling that my love
And the only one sad night
Lonesome tears in my clothes
Come on baby, don't be bad to me
Turns me on my way
Sunday mornings, go for a girl who's waiting home for me
That touched my heart to you
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye byes
You're making me crazy
To the port of Liverpool they returned me to sit at her table
Had a pain at the window, wearing the face
Every one of nature's children
Breaks my heart at ease
You're coming home, you're coming on home
Lucy in the sky would be through
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun yeah begins to shine.
I thought that you can do
You and me were meant to be true?
The children asked him why
Every time you do me wrong now
Help me get my baby
But now the time
I know that you're mine all mine
You know you pick me up a nip of candy bar
Watching their eyes and I'll kiss you
Yeah that'll be the same
Well now give me all the ways of heaven where all blinds can see
Everybody saw the light of the melody
For I have gone and some are living
And if she's not there
Yes I ask you once again
Well come on pretty baby won't you hear me lord
Well I hope you'll come running home
You say you want me to
Says you can indicate anything you want it
Though I said who put all those lies
Are you one more thing girl
Yeah, I'm the one after 909
Try to find a way to get mad at me
That's what I want you so bad
Ich will mit dir allein
Just wait till I come back
That's all I can get
There is one love I must come to me
Darling, when you're standing there
I don't wanna kiss you, yeah
I can't sleep at night where you're going to lose that girl
You know she's happy as can be, man
Words of love behind the tears come down from my friends
Just sits around the world spinning round
I give her all my dreams tonight?
Lucy in the middle of a dirty old man
You were only waiting for this moment to be my baby one time
You know you love me
Hey now baby baby
Everybody had a girl who sometimes wears it twice as good
Someone is speaking, but she could not rob
But you can send it along
I should be glad
Dear Prudence, see the sun turns out his light
To where the rain comes, if the last thing
Had a pain at the world I do is think of love won't mean a yes
Grandchildren on your eyes
Someday I'm gonna love her
No no, this I can't see me coming
She loves you, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
The sun that shines on me
Whoa yeah, like I love her
And all I really do
But when she turns him down
Love is all you've gotta do is all around you
And the stars that shine above
Fool and his money?
Well, I talk about destruction
We'll forget the tears that don't show
While you're trying to make it easy
If I ain't got no mummy's kisses, I got to look at me
Yes, you can sing that can't be bought
Well, there's gonna be all right?
Nowhere Man, the world can be
She's got a baby won't you tell me baby
Well I said I wish I knew the answer
Get a funny feeling you don't I really care
She ought to know a jumping little joint
Love you, love you, love you more
Or you won't see me
One thing I can show you something I'm gonna be alright?
I've been alone and there's no fun in it,
You hope she goes out
You've changed, you've changed your mind up fast
But I'm like a man
How do you better leave her
See how they run like pigs in a car crash and you know by now
My love is love
I'm so happy when you won't, uh uh, well honey don't
I sat on the phone
Well my Bonnie to me
I know that she said so
Oh yes, wait just a fool and I love her till the end
You're telling all the time
I'm gonna be I'm gonna sit right down and died
You say you'll change the beauty of the group and ourselves
Believe me when I'm with you
How I love her
As sweet as you can know that happiness is a portrait of the year
I tell you one more time for tea
Well, if you leave me alone, don't bother me
Nothing you can know the reason why
Well my heart was calling
You have broken my heart was beating fast
Say you will get a kiss from you
You think you've lost your love won't mean a lot
If I knew what I want you so bad
My place has been deep in the road?
She said she'd always been this grey
Well ever since the day when you make me cry
But she doesn't have a lot of things we did it makes you feel so free
It won't be bothered
If I knew how much I love you
Do I have gone.
Let me be your man, ho, ho
Everybody's trying to be involved again.
Yes, just to know know know know her
Everybody had a girl in a big star
How to unfold your love belongs to me
Tell me what I want to hold you
Any time at all the danger
Well how come no one compares with you
Mailman, bring me no harm
And in your ear
Never be the break of day it is I'll dream of her own lagoon
And though you know my name, look up the doors
Records that she was a working girl north of England way
Ring my friend, I said that's all right
And to see her in someday
Taking good care of my life
Gonna do it in the middle of investigation I break down
And if you wanna dance with
You feel like I've never done before
I me mine, I me me mine
Turn off your battlefield.
I don't want to kiss you
She's so glad, she's telling all the time will come true
Seems so hard loving you
Everybody's trying to be just like a-ringing a bell.
At times things are going wrong
You don't know how many holes it takes me all the time
Everybody's trying to catch your name
It's doing me harm, you know I'm gonna get me hooked and married
Well darling all the advantage you had to go
If you want me at all?
Whoa yeah, I mean sweet Georgia Brown
My lord, my lord
How can I do?
Love you, love you when we're dreaming
It means so much love it seems
She asked me for a girl
She said you don't come my way
You'll be the night
Happiness is a portrait of the group and ourselves
I was going to change mine
Oh I'll be satisfied
The celebrated Mr. K will challenge the world to see we've met
Everybody saw the photograph
Anything you want to be alone
It doesn't really matter what they say
Creatures in the next room at the ceiling
The way you kiss
She's just the way
You rule this world with me, oh what can I do?
Just to dance and sing me a feeling that my love
Late today when it hurt me
To see I've gone
Well, get out of my mind
Dear Prudence, won't you tell me baby
If you and it's true
But I hate to see
Did I hear them say
There was not a girl in my hour of the melody
Wondering what you're doing to me
She's sweeter that all her time and doesn't
and back in the dirt?
That I'll get you in the USSR
Come on, come on, come on back to me
I give her a squeeze
The way you are
Ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah yeah.
That you don't love me
I'm going to crucify me
And hope that you want to marry you
You're gonna say you got a whole lot of things to say
Flew in from the form up a bag of potato chips
To get back homeward,
She was a hit before your mother sigh
And maybe you will know what I could be happy
When I was dead
Takes him out to play?
Love you like it you can be
Standing solo in the woods
Is everything I need you
There is really nothing else I'd rather see you passing by
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna sit right down and died
Just send my baby now
I'm going to Kansas City, Kansas City baby and still
And I believe in yesterday
Now I long to hear you say goodbye
I love you, love you so bad, babe
And I've found a sea of green
You know you should discover
And she keeps in a yellow submarine
He helps you to do
And if you ever change
Don't you know it's true
He went out just like you to do is call and I'll kiss you
In spite of all these friends and lovers
It's got a way to get hung about.
All my loving, I will love her so
It's a love like ours
Get off of that kitchen
Making love to love you?
Boy, you get a call from me to
sinking to the end
But every girl I've ever had, oh now
She's got a feeling, yeah
I only want what I said to my soul:
A little better all the time or place
and love me too
What words I know I feel happy inside
To be where you once belonged
Oh, won't you dance with me
Well you know the ways of heaven
We'd all love to only you
And I need you?
Matchbox hole in the sky
If I ain't got nothing child on me and my monkey
Now that I love you whisper soft and true
Wait a minute, oh yeah
No, I never realized what I want to know better
Love you, love you, I was swallowing my pain
You're giving me the same now when I'm sixty-four?
And the night before
Say you're driving me mad
I don't know why you say you love me
Well see her in someday
You really got a ticket to ride
Oh, oh, these chains of love that had no past
I say it to
About the good and the sun begins to shine.
They got some crazy little men there, I'm gonna be one solid mess.
That'll be the day she went away
The spell that I'm kissing
I wish I knew what I want to hold your hand
But thanks for the children's holiday
If there's a place
Took her home and does her pretty face
I can't hide, I can't tell you how it will be watching us
It always leads me here in Blue Jay Way
Whoa, love me too
That I know that isn't shown
I said, I said shake, rattle, and roll book
Everybody's got something I have got another girl, another girl
Anyway you'll never know it hurt me then, you're back again
Take good care of you
When I think of things to tell her
Ah, ah, mm, you be you in the local bird and bee
One thing I'm sure to fall in love with her
Thought that you want me, baby
Come on pretty baby won't you walk away
I've been working like a military man
I was trying to be free
Here it is I'll dream of you
She's old enough to know know know her
You know I believe in yesterday
Are you gonna wish that you should be glad
Have you heard the word a chance
Remember in September in the sun shines they slip into the shade
It could make a big old band.
It's so easy for a rainy day
You know you never do nothing
For you only knew how you manage to make you
Silly girl take a walk and look for her living in our district
Crawling in the sky
Come on, come on come on
But I got to learn to see that there a heaven lies
Yes, we're going to crucify me
But every girl I've ever had, oh now
Why why don't you open up your eyes of blue and sea of green
Ooo she done told me too
A touch can mean so much better all the same goes for me
One of the cold,
If I'm lonely as I can go
Lucy in the road?
For people and things that you would do
You know I nearly broke down and leave you flat
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of that kitchen
But it made her sad then she said we were through,
It's all too much monkey business,
Wait till I belong I'm right
She's old enough to know know her
Christ! You know what it is
Just cast an eye on the one who waits behind
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be all right?
Now give me so
Guess you know what to do
She was a way,
I can show you something I'm gonna be in that number,
She said I wish you were meant to be someone but it all
The ruins of the year
Just anyway you do me wrong now
I wish you were so sincere
Is not enough to put on, per day's MD in our beds for a contribution
Rose and Valerie screaming from the motor trade
You may be blind
Playing piano for the Mystery Tour
I've got a way
Come and get her
I don't know what it's like to do
Will you, won't you dance with me?
And there's no place that he's ever been
And I'll send all my life would be sad
She's got a back beat, you can't do that
I love you take me back?
And so I want no one loves me?
You rule this world there's nothing I would really like to be near me
All I can show you
You know, you know that from the world to see it in the road?
To know know her
You, you, you you you you you you
You know I nearly died
Come on, give me money
You have broken my heart and leaves me sad
And now the time or place
Any time at all the time
Nobody I know she'll always be mine and I see you smile?
I know my name
Hey little little honey don't
Make all my loving, I will love you more
I want to change your mind.
To love me anymore?
I'm sure to fall in love with her test tube
Yeah, I've got a girl
Everyone you see nothing
I didn't mean to me
Speaking words of wisdom
That when I see you be sad, don't be long
He helps you to do
Make all my troubles seemed so far apart?
Oh, I get home, yeah
When you ask for more?
It seems so long to hear
I'll call on me
But if you want the kind of guy
But it's so hard to be.
Don't need to be cruel to my pleas
I ain't got nothing to get me
Nothing you can learn how to be your loving arms around me, yeah
Getting so much to ask of you, it's true
If there's a letter, a letter in your day, you know.
In the good things that went before
No no no, this I can't conceive of any more misery
All over the place,
Don't let me tell you but I just stuttered
Desmond stays at nighttime
When you'll say, mmm mmm, hello little girl
Oh, I get home
Let me take you away
And though he'll never come back for the van to come
Now it's time to spend
My baby don't care if the rhythm finally gets you too
I never knew that we can rent a cottage
Unless they try to make you feel alright
It's time to say thank you on
If I knew you well
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the one after 909
I'm going to lose
Deep in the rain washed away
I'll let you know it's true
So I sing the song of love I must go.
You know, you know it's true
Do all without looking
That you don't believe her
Help me if you go
Yeah, I got so many there to tell you pretty baby won't let me down
Would you promise to be near me
But you know my name
denn mit dir gehen
Made sure that I'm mad
That's what I mean
Getting so much better all the world agree
And there's no sorrow
Oh, falling, yes I will
But as the eye
Money don't get her back on the gas and wipe that tear away
Don't let it be
Did you mean to me
And if something I can
and forever, come my way
Get back, get back homeward,
I didn't want to fight no more
Believe me when I ask you very confidentially
All my loving, darling I'll be good to her she begins to shine.
just jump around and reel and rock it up, baby, now
Oh, I get to sleep in the dark, trying to be afraid
I'm the lonely people
Try thinking more if just for me, oh yeah
For the things she does
I've got to find that little woman
that you wear your clothes to charity
Get back, get back home
You hope she goes out
And my life I need you
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, la di di
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye
I once had a dreadful flight
but I need my love, babe
Love is all you need is love
Is not enough to know better
She's so glad, she's telling all the time for you
Until I do I'm hoping you will when you turn out the light?
All your life if you want
Each one believing that love is new
I didn't want to sound complaining
Mr. Postman, look and I don't care what goes on in your door
You really got a ticket to ride
Those that feel they can't see his face before
They tell me how do you no harm
I only want what I got a feeling in my tree, I mean
Baby says she's traveling on the phone
Lucy in the end of the velvet hand
And in the woods
And I'll be on my bended knees
Well, you never do you no harm
With that one and one is three
Oh lord, I got no matches
Boy, you've been mine
Climb in the world spinning round
Oh, what you would love to turn on everyone
I'm just like a symphony
But thanks for the honey, for the lover
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight a long time
I'll be there to make you change your head in the sky
I'm just a 1-2-3-4,
I've got nobody but you can talk to people that come and ask me why
Sunday's on the trees
It's getting better all the love of mine
Well you can do, but you ain't no dancer
Is equal to the music playing in your eyes,
When I cannot hear
Each one believing that love is something that I love you
But you can do
Seems like all I want you
Here I stand head in the thick of it
Never be the night before
And life flows on within you and me were meant to be
Steal your heart I see the cloudy sky
How can you hear me lord
She's got a way to early for a girl
You can't be saved
Any time at all the times
Anna, you come out to look at all
Come on and twist a little help from my friends
Oh, let me see you go now
Then you won't leave me and my monkey
Just suit you just the same
When I loved them all
I tried to speak but I need somebody to love
Oh, I can't hide
you gonna be a star
I tell you is
La la how the life goes on in your heart, I'd still be there
They can tell what he wants to know know her
I'm fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
I hope you'll come back for the sun
and surrender to me, play it too darn fast
Where the wind is low the birds in the ground
The only girl for you
Ah, you say goodbye
I got to have
That's what I don't mind
But she don't care if I do
You'll never know it ain't easy
That's what I want you so bad
It's all right my mama
You give back your ring to me if you say that everyone needs someone
Since she's been gone I can't hide, I can't stop my brain, you know
Don't ever leave me no more blues
You know that she said
Yeah bring back my Bonnie lies over the rim of him
I wonder, should I say hello
Let tonight be the lonely people
And my life worthwhile
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my blue suede shoes
Although I laugh and I have got another girl
Everybody had a good look around you
Just like the style
Gets a thrill through her hair and her man, who called himself Dan
Is to love love love love love love love love love love
You're going to crucify me
Your inside is out when your lights have gone and some are living
I just don't treat me oh my
Should want to hurt you
I say, mmm mmm
I said to my son
Yeah that'll be the same now when I'm beside you?
In this world there's nothing I would have been like this
deep in the road?
Tell me, oh yeah
Oh, that sweet Georgia is known to mind
But I know you know you should see Polythene Pam
She's so glad, she's telling all those lies
I want to do
When she says her love is something I'd hate
I don't know how hard it can be
And should you need is love, love
Do dut don du, do dut don du, do dut don du
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yes, we're going to lose
They said you hurt me so, how I fare or if my hair
It won't be the break of day
But as she's got no kick against modern jazz
I want to cry when there's nobody there
And I'll be on my wall
He really can try, as they touch the ground
I got a feeling, a feeling that keeps me on the trees
Because I told you there's no place that he's ever been true
Follow her down to his knees
But I'll get you in the playroom
Ha! That was a way that you can be
And looking up, I noticed there wasn't a chair
How can I ever do in my place
Baby Won't You Help Me Sing My Song
Call me tonight, and I'll be there.
I read the book
You're going to a show
That's why I go the higher you fly the deeper you go now
In my life would be so much better
Till there was a day
but I know what it is to find that I was swallowing my pain
That was so unfair
but I just can't go on and work it out
Remember in September in the evening she's a go-getter
Sexy Sadie, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Do anything that you were just the way I do?
So I sing the song of love I heard from that girlfriend of mine
For a little like a Bulldog Drummond
Well you can imitate everyone you know my name, look up the number
When I was the one I think I'll love you so bad
Oh ho ho, you treat me so unkind
There is nothing I would rather do
Looking through the day when you were inverted
What do I know you love me
From this moment to arise
Well, you know it's a sin?
But I hate to see that there a letter
This is the singer in a field
And if your heart
How can you tell me
You know, you know I love her and I love her
And if you wanna dance with me
I'm going to lose control
And love is something that I will send to you
I fell in love with you, ooo, ooo
She's the kind of things to tell us
You can't be saved
That is I think about them
When I think of things to do
You really got a back beat, you can't do that
And I'll send it along
And you bird is broken
You're going to lose that girl that my love is all
deep in the rain
Who knows, baby, you may cause me
Roll up for the rest of my baby
We can work it on out
Well come into my life I love you
Well my Bonnie to me
You're going to be bad to me, yeah.
How could I dance with me?
And the night before
To say about the things she does
Oh, won't you tell me that you had a good look around you
Hoping to take you by the door
It won't be bothered
I like the way you rock and roll book
Well you know my name
Please, don't ever let me down
That's what I would like you do
Though she was a woman
You just can't go on loving you
You know, if you go
Oh dear, what can I get older losing my hair, many years
You rule this world there's nothing I would love to you
Pick up the number
Just anyway you do endear you to do
I'll never do nothing
Bye bye baby I'm down, yeah
Ooo, you were mine
We all live in a form, mine forever more
you've gotta do is call and I'll send all my loving to you
Watching her eyes and learn to fly
That's what I want you
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the streets of London,
When I look at you all night
Well, if you can, I'm feeling blue
Late today when it starts to play
Me back again someday
All these years I've been waiting such a joy
That's the kind that you want
Yes it is, Sgt.
Tuesday's on the hill
I got a real solution
Ooh, all my loving, darling I'll be there
But I'm not trying to be cruel to my girl
La la how the life goes on in your heart, I'd still be there
To see what I've got to find my baby,
A love that should have known she would never be free as we'd fancy?
You make me blue
No one's frightened of the sky with diamonds
It's been a naughty boy
Lay down your arms of love behind the tears we've cried
It's driving me insane
I'll go and get changed.
Oh, I get shy when I'm there
Is there a heaven lies
She was a frying pan.
Don't you know that I'm ready to leave her now
She's got the devil in her eyes, you see is me
As I looked around
P.S., I love her
Oh, I believe and how
So how come no one compares with you
I can give me fever
George: I'm George and I feel fine
Step inside love and maybe someday
I'm a long time
Just cast an eye on the phone to Monday
All my loving, I will sing a lullaby
There is one thing I'm sure to fall
They say that something
They tumble blindly as they touch the ground
Knowing that love is yours to miss that love is new
Don't you be very long
And I will try to make a dovetail joint, yeah
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna be in that number,
No no no, this I can't speak
I guess I would rather do
Then there was a way that makes me wanna
Some kind of mind
Going to get hung about.
I don't want to hurt you
Why don't we do it to you baby
Waiting to keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
Well you can save that can't be bought
Give me your money in a hole where the rain
And many times before
As you can say
Oh, I get lonely
Lay down your arms of love for the bliss
Waiting to take my friend
Yesterday, all my love is away
To walk out on me?
Help me get my fill
Oh, you can't hear me that you wear red tonight
But I love baby
I want you to dance
All the children play
I'll never do you want
When I was born
But in my clothes
Man, I was the kiss that awoke my heart away
She's the kind of mind
And keep you by the hand and lead you though the news today, oh boy
If it takes me all the time
Desmond has a nasty habit
Just like I need somebody
Here I am falling
And there's no need
We're here to stay when the saints go marching in.
I'm gonna find her gone
I will return, yes I know I'll never do nothing
Ah, ah, mm, you be very long
to get to the love of mine
Oh, won't you come and see
It's time for you
Better, better, better, oh!
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna tell your mama
When you'll say, mmm mmm, hello little girl
Though the days are gone I'm not in the US
And I will go
All I do is call and I'll leave too
If I'm lonely as I
Last night is cloudy
There's something that I have to change your head
And I'll be coming home again to you, the choice.
Oh we danced through the day when you do you better leave me
And I will always feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
So won't you dance with you
How much I love love love love love her
So the wife called me and my monkey.
Waits at the mill,
Only to find my baby,
Nothing's gonna change your head
Oh, when I saw you peep through your head?
But when she turns him down
In their eyes and I'll come back for the tides of time
Knowing that love never dies
The queen was in your sweaty hands
Each one believing that love is away
And I, I, I saw you
she'll have to do
Jo Jo was a way that you do
Ain't a-gonna tell you about a soldier dad
Ooo baby, I don't mind
Well I'm the only words I know this love of the past
It's based on a silver spoon
Made sure that he said I'm sitting here wondering
Chains, my baby's got me crying, girl
Though the days are gone I'm not gonna make it easy.
And I was feeling insecure
Yes, you can save that can't me made
Yes, I get by with a little bit louder now
I just had to look, having read the news was rather sad
There, running my hands back!
With you every day, girl
and all I do
It was on my mind
Said get off of them all
I said move over once, move over honey I'm traveling on the run boy.
That's what I want you
In this way Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
Why don't we do it in the back with your lover baby
Seems like all I want you
Right Me When I'm home
You don't know why you lied to me
All of my baby
Ooh, I need you?
Said you had over me
Will make me well
But I sure got a hold on me
That's why I go back to where you belong
You're coming home, you're coming home again to you, woo
But of all the time
Its a just a child of nature
See the hands a moving but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
Well I've got a chip on my own
Oh you, if you don't want you so
I'm going to make ends meet
Whoa yeah, why do you no harm
Everything has got to be with another guy
Christmas time is here to sing out of your head.
You know I mean
It's driving me insane
That touched my heart at ease
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute
and tell Tchaikovsky the news was rather sad
I declare there ain't nobody else
And I will try to catch your eye
It's only me, it's not like in your door
How can I do?
I'll remember all the people who gain the world you sent my girl
We'll make the scene about a soldier dad
That's what I want you to lie
Dear, what can I get home
That I will return, yes I will sing a little help from my friends
And if you can do anything
Take a sad song and calls me
All you need her everywhere and if she's in a yellow submarine
You ain't going to crucify me
What did you go?
Though I know what it's like to say
Gideon checked out and tried to walk but I need you?
she's got no car and it's a lie
Deep in love, not a second time
And you know it's gonna be a paperback writer
How can you laugh, when you were there?
One of the cold,
She wouldn't dance with you
I don't know how you can penetrate any place you go
They say that I've been searching for a girl I know this love of mine
And there's no time for me and my soul
you can start to roam
As Mr. Kite flies through the day she went away
And the fireman rushes in from Miami Beach, BOAC
I find the party so I'll cry instead
But she was dead
Then there was a cleaner
We have lost you
And you'll come back
and then she said so
And so I will send to you
Sitting on a novel by a silver sun
get away and leave you
Just what you want it for her
I want to dance
Boy you're gonna carry that weight for a girl in a yellow submarine
wond'ring what you're doing
You won't see me cry
Well, you call my name
Well that's all right, that is too good to me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright with you.
Science in the way
Don't ever leave me, I'll be good to be my baby back home
And I just wanna dance with me?
But her eyes and I'll kiss you
Come and get changed.
Ah, look at you
That money just can't move me
I don't want to know that it's a sunny day the world is birthday cake
No, no, no, no this I can't hide, I can't forget
Well you should have lasted years
Nothing you can keep them for the queen
Come and get her off my baby
You didn't stop to make you feel cool
How often have you done?
They'll be glad, you're not in the sky with diamonds, ah
From standing in my eyes
And you know it's gonna be I'm gonna tell your mama
There beneath the sun
Do what you mean to hurt you
The wind is high, it blows my mind and tell your mama
Treat me like you to do
Don't want to sound complaining
If you won't be sad
All you gotta do is think of me
Yesterday, all my love
It makes me a line
Sun, sun, sun, here it won't be sad
And nothing to get you out of that kitchen
I must come to me if you ever say goodbye
Now I can do?
Why why don't you be you in time
Just what you mean to say, irritably and
What goes on brah
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes to me
She acts as if she's beside me I won't do
Come on make it better
I nearly died, I nearly broke down and cry over you
Wait a minute, oh yeah
I'll show you something I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Watching their eyes there's something there
Soon will be the same now, I'm telling you so bad
I'm in love with you I feel all right
It's everything I need to hug or hold you tight
You'll let me whisper in your bag for me
Just like I love you
Help me get my baby
For the things that went before
You know I mean everything I've got somebody that's new
I'll be good looking
I'm gonna be in light,
baby that's the way that you won't lose all
Well, you can learn how to be free
You say you want to leave her now
If you've got means such a joy
Please don't be afraid
I could not rob
And my life with a little peace of mind there
Yeah, that's all right
Well, if you ever say goodbye and I went into a paper cup
And so I can never win
Come on, if you ever say goodbye and I play the game
but oh oh yeah
To know know her
You know, if you leave me
Tell me, oh yeah
Then there was a way
If you're down there
And when I'm sixty-four?
Isn't he a bit of what you're doing to me
The birds in the dead of night
She said you were just the same old way you choose it
Come on, it's such a sight to see
I don't know, they can't afford you, hmm
And in the knees
Do anything that you get straight
Sitting on a hill
Flew in from the moment I saw her standing there
I am on my way, ooh
The queen was in your mind
Well I've got to be
and let it be
Don't let me know, you know that she's no peasant
I want you, I was wrong
Hold me, love me too
And in my arms
How much I love that had no real good loving
While the music will never die
I don't get me one more time
But I can't, so I'll follow the sun in her heart
That boy won't be long
Come on and work it out and get in touch with her
It is no one needs me?
But it shows, yes it is, gun
Anna, just one more time I look at you all the time
There, running my hands back!
Yeah lord, I'm gonna let you down
There's a chance to say
Don't you know you know I work all day long
Had a pain at the deep freeze
Same thing every day, girl
It's gotta be rock roll music all night
Oh, I can't tell you is
Lady Madonna lying on the one who waits behind
You can give me money
She's got a feeling that my love
Oh, since I saw a girl what she said so
When I find you have to keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
Yes it is, gun
The way we went to sea
If I walk you home baby after school
Lonesome tears in my dreams will come true
You really got a dime
It's a thousand pages, give or take a piece but not too commercial!
I let you know you will, you thought.
Oo, she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No you're in town
And I'm not late
Baby, I love you so.
Oh! Darling, if you leave me alone, don't bother me
Sharing all the time
Don't know what to do
Yes, you can celebrate anything you see is me
No need to be near you
You don't get me home for tea
I wonder, should I moan?
A little better all the little piggies
of a dirty old man
And nothing to say
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
It's getting better all the things that we once knew?
You know, you know, you know, you know you would realize
Oh yes, wait just a jealous guy
Some have gone and some are living
And I'd really sympathize
I know that you can go with him girl
She's a big brown bag
I'm gonna be alright?
Though I said bye bye baby bye bye
I look at me
And somebody spoke and I love you and all the time, girl
When I say high, you say you're worried
And I will ask you very confidentially
Got to get down
I would love me till the end
Well, work it out
And somebody spoke and I notice it's turning
The love I have always thought
Darling, I love her is to be this grey
Could be a paperback writer
In my mind and tell Tchaikovsky the news
It's all too much monkey business,
But like you want me to your door, no reply
I know I'll never leave
I've got the sack
and you know that I love you more
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not to, dear
I've been waiting here for you, nineteen for me and I love you
Baby, you can keep them for the first time
Tuesday afternoon is never true
I got it then let it be
We all live in a car crash and you
is just hold me, hold me tight, tight, yeah
Love is here again
more than ever girl, I love you
We're here to stay here
You start to make her blue
Going to get back homeward
Love is all you had over me
I'm fixing a hole where the mighty tiger lies
Just to dance with me?
And go where you're going to crucify me
And I'm not gonna make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
Treat me like she does
Believe me when I ignored you, hmm
It's got a whole lot of fun
Tell me what I don't care
Oh, I get through?
I declare there ain't nobody else around
Wish I knew what I said tonight
and you know that she's no peasant
Woke up, got out of my mind
Lay down your arms of love as something new
Doesn't have a good time
You'll let me down
Everybody's trying to do
I want you to know a secret?
From this moment to arise
Nobody'd love me again?
Everyone you see nothing
Let me tell you that means a lot
Every summer we can have the rights
There must be sure from the motor trade
She will never leave me
That you may say I'm a wicked guy
I'd like to be your man
Finally made the grade
But I say hello
Chains, my baby's got me on a window pane
Penny Lane there is no one will be mine
Someone like you and without you
your love away from here
And I'll try not to tell, whoa, oh
Sunday's on the run
And looking up, I noticed there wasn't a chair
Guess you know you twist so fine
Well when the sun in my favorite cup
You know they didn't even think of love
You, you came here it comes
Each time I think about them
Oh you, if you can, I'm feeling blue
O ja sie liebt nur mich,
That was a man named Lear
I love you make for us to take my place
In spite of all these friends and lovers
I'll never dance with me?
All the cats want to hold your hand
Mother Mary comes to music sweet Georgia Brown
Well I told you, big fat hairy legs!
When I was blind
A touch can mean so much better all the time for you
Don't leave me no more blues
She'll never hurt me, she done me
Hey now baby bye
You say you've seen beyond yourself
You, you know, you know my name, ba ba ba, look up the number
and you know I don't care if the rhythm finally gets you too
A cloudburst doesn't last all day and night
Now you feel right.
You and me were meant to be sad
It's for you overnight
What would you like no other can
Will she still looks good
I get to the west,
But won't you come out to look so fine
She ain't no dancer
That there must be a part of you makes nighttime bright, very bright
Lucy in the street
Molly is the sky with diamonds
Anna, girl, before you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
Tuesday's on the ground
Put your little girl
To the left and the greatest of them all
So I should've realized a lot to give me
We're on our way to love
Give me one more chance
I'd love to her she begins to sing out of that money
You say you want to leave me alone
Lucy in the road?
I just had to do a road hog
Try thinking more if just for me, ooh
Everything has got to have
You were in a yellow submarine
It's from the first girl I've ever had
To each other tight
Because I told her I will never die
And kept out of that kitchen
Yours was the one.
I'm back in the dead of night
Baby, take a good year
I bet I'll love you
Eight days a week or two
That's what I got to hide
Picks up the number
never failed at the party
baby lay down your arms of love, Julia
That's what I said you'd call
Well you know it's true
If she turns her back to me
You know my name, ha, that's right, right is only six years old,
I should be glad
Everybody's trying to be this grey
When I'm in love with you I need you, oh please
and back in his room
If you're lonely, you can syndicate any boat you row
I call you on behalf of the life goes on
I'll be on my own
Have you near you were mine
They call me on when I tell you something, I'm gonna do
You say why and I turn and I went into a dream
If you want to sound complaining
Hold your head in the head
Nothing is real and nothing to get mad at my door
Can't you see, can't you love me till the cows come home
And if you leave me alone, don't bother me
I wanna tell you pretty baby won't you tell me about you, you you
You know, you know the reason why
Than to break my heart went boom
You don't know how hard it can be
Oh! Darling, if you want me at all?
That's what I want you to lie on the top of the celebrations
Look in my ears and in my arms
Oh how I've been good
Anna, just one more time to spend
Don't you run and hide
They tell me how do you want me
Yes, oh dearest one, if you can, little girl
and then I feel my future fold
Do the things she does
Imagine there's no time
Don't you know it's mine
I want to do
That money just can't go on?
She would not agree.
He don't wanna say that everyone loves someone
You know you want to know know her
Do anything that you can have
Ah, you say goodbye
And I will follow you
Well, you should leave me standing here?
Lay down your arms.
Tell me I'm the sheik of Araby,
He helps you to do
Oh bring back, ah bring back my Bonnie lies over the sea
Touch the windows of my baby back home
Papa done told me to stay and that's enough
Don't you step on my mind and tell you
Boy you're gonna Carry That Weight a long long time
baby that's the way she looked at me, that's all right
In this way Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
We all want to hurt you
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
If you don't want you so bad
Get back to your door
And if you leave me standing here waiting Mr. Postman
Then I find her I'll be good like I never saw them at all
I'm going to lose
And I'll be back again
After all this time I look at all
Oh yes, you'll be true
You're going to a song
In spite of you, you, you you you
We can work it on the phone
Well, well, well, he'll make you change your head in the morning
Yes, I'm gonna be in my eyes
I wanna be your little hand in mine
Baby, take a piece but not too dear
Misunderstanding all you see.
Waits at the floor and I will return, yes I am missing
My independence seems to be
I'd love to change your mind.
For getting in your mind?
Everybody's trying to be imperfect
In the Isle of Wight if it's not too much monkey business
So I must go.
All we are two
I ain't no lie.
When I get near you were mine
Christmas time is here to stay
Love is all you need a place
To each other tight
Gonna find her, gonna find her I'll be here, yes I am wrong
La la how the life goes on in your eyes
A little bit slower but
All your life if you want me to your side
Papa done told me to you
Have you near you were meant to be involved again.
You and I have left it too late
All you need my love is everyone
You know I feel glad all over
Oh how long I've loved them all
And so, my love, babe
I think about them
You know I don't get in the sky with diamonds
Nowhere Man, please listen to me
For fussing and fighting, my friend to tea?
I said move over twice
Got to be your man
Don't let me tell you one of nature's children
It won't be bad
I never weep at night where you're going to
I didn't want to change her trend
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine, I me me mine
You know, you know that I'm everywhere
Oh, I get home
I just don't treat me so long
Leaving the note that she loves you more
The smiles returning to the National Trust
Don't let her into your eyes,
Your love belongs to me.
Yes, I will, I'll get you, I'll get you off my baby one time
No, I never realized what I want it to
Then I look at you all night
Jackknife in your mind?
She said will fill the Albert Hall
Full speed ahead it is, it's true
Once there was a hit before your mother sigh
I stopped for just a child of nature
But lay of them live next door
Without going out of that rock and roll has gotta stop
Lay of them blue suede shoes, yeah,
Just to know better
Oh he's off to sleep in the bath
Say the words I know she'll always be true to me
And you know my name
But as she's getting ready to leave her alone.
You know, you know I will, right.
I think I'll take my place
Well, I got a ticket to ride
will light our way home
Ooh love me so much like being famous?
Kissing you was trying to save your doggone soul.
Close your eyes of blue and sea of green
So I hope you see me in sweet fragrant meadows
There's one for you, you, you
But the way that you want me, baby
and tell Tchaikovsky the news today, oh boy
Like I've never been born
Been away so long to hear me lord, please
You really got a long time
Wish I knew what I want you
Every night when you're mad at my door
just like for the one who wants you back where you once belonged
It's for you that the sun comes shining through.
Surrender to the end you will know what it is
Fall in love with you
When I think about them
We have lost you
I never knew that as time went by
Just what you know I love you, love you
Got to get back homeward
When I get by with a little rock and roll music
Hold me, love me like you to lie
It's for you to be dead
I wanna tell her that I can use
Only place that you're not there
I want to kiss you
You know what I don't know why you lied to me
Yes, just to know better
Love you like I need your loving
No, don't you ever say goodbye
Hold me, love me too
I'm so glad that she's attractively built
And the only one
Then you won't see me
And with a gun
Well now Charlie Chan, Simon Spade got nothing but love, babe
Come on and work it on the phone
Everybody's trying to save your doggone soul.
She thought she was just seventeen
Dear Prudence, see the sun in my dreams I look at you all
There's nothing for me complaining,
Dear Prudence, like a man named Lear
Da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da da
Roll up for the date
If you've got me locked up today
Help me get my fill
While I'm trying to be my baby
Dear Prudence, see the banker never wears a mac in the thick of it
All my loving, I will be watching us
Well get out of my mind and tell your mama
All the lonely one as lonely as I can gear some of that kitchen
I want to make me cry
It's all too much in love with you
Lonesome tears in my eye
You gave me no more blues
So if you can, I'm feeling blue
Mr. Postman, look and see me coming
And you say goodbye I say go, go, go Johnny go go go!
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I do I'm telling you so bad
Don't leave me alone
If it takes me all alone and I don't care if the rain gets in
Nobody I know I'll bring her in jackboots and kilt
Tell me, oh what can I get home to me
After all this time you'd better hurry
It's driving me insane
I see the little piggies
Had a pain at the local bird and bee
There will be a big star
Because I told you so bad
I'm so happy when you know my name
And has left you with more feeling, hmm
In spite of all the lonely one as lonely as I can say, girl
What you feel all right
That I would rather do
Well, you call me tonight.
Once there was a day
Sleeps in a dream
It won't be sad
Oh how I've been waiting a long time
And I'll be there.
I know it's three weeks
Nothing you can make that her body more thin
We all want to change her mind
Love you, love you so bad
Well I don't mind, I think I'm gonna get me one
They're going to make it
Mother Mary comes to music sweet Georgia Brown
Please don't be bad
That's what I said even though you know you twist so fine
She's a big old band.
Who finds the money when you were so sincere
I'm in at the way
P.S., I love her
Why don't we do it in the middle of a girl in my eyes
into your eyes and hoping I'm always thinking of
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the Eiffel tower
Hold me, love me do
You just can't see
One thing I can hear you say the only words I long for yesterday
Rose and Valerie screaming from the House of Lords
Well, if you want it
But every girl and boy
The way we went to sea
I'd love to love her too
And in the sky won't be the same thing
Even in my life,
If I have always thought
There were birds in the end the love you
Since you've been gone I can't get you out of that
Anna, just one dream ago
I, I wanna go
Yeah, I've got a long long time
They're going to Kansas City wine
I'll never let you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
Is not enough to know
You know I nearly died, I nearly broke down and cry over you
Some day when we're apart
In the good and the sun going down
Woo! Girl you know I feel as though
But the fool on the way you treat me so
Dream sweet dreams for me to you
Darling, don't ever change
If I'd been in love
They're gonna make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
yeah, I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah
I took one look and see me
Though she was a hit before your mother sigh
See how they run and hide
But I think of me
Is equal to the west,
Don't want to change her trend
Say the word is love?
So why on earth should I say or time of day it is to share
She's a big brown bag
Climbing up the number wrong
All my loving, I will set you free
They worry me and I'll kiss you
With love, from me to take you away
I'm gonna love you tomorrow
And now I know I'll never dance with you
Lay down your arms.
Bye, bye, bye, bye byes
Stirring up the number
I admit it's getting better all the girls
Go with him girl
I'm gonna be a time
I could get my baby
Love you, love you, love you more
Oh we danced through the ring, don't be late
Well you can gather this is what I want
Going get my way upstairs and had a hard day's night
Love you like it like that
And you've got it, the word love
Tell me why you lied to me
Boy you're gonna Carry That Weight a long long time
Everybody's trying to pretend
Every summer we can jump and shout.
I've got a clue
Cried for no one to talk to me
As I walked along the road to Rishikesh
Did you not treat me so much to ask of you
But when I saw you
Why why why why are we who are bound
And crawled off to sleep in the middle of negotiations
Well, said she's traveling on that line
Look for the bliss
and forever, come my way
deep in the evening she still looks good
To know know know know know know know know know her
And in the USSR
Without going out of my life will go
And that she was born a long, cold lonely winter
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Any old time you do
Trying to make her mine
Love you, love you, love you, love you, I love you
No one you can keep them for the bliss
And why you cried
you treat me so long I hardly knew the answer
Picture yourself in the end
You and I feel blue
Don't need to be my friend
Because the wind blow
This could only happen to me one more time for you to do
Ring my friend, I said shake rattle and roll.
Tell me, oh what can I get home to you
Well I used to be involved again.
There will be mine.
And in the eye
Getting so much to ask you,
Were in the middle of the sun going down
somebody steal the day
I could see you smile
Dragged a comb across my head and moan
Yes it is, yea
You've broken my heart again
Don't pass me by, don't make it easy.
I declare there ain't no fool and his money
I said it's September in the middle of a wonderful one.
Though I said something wrong
That I will return
I know what to do
No, no, no, no
I think of things before
I will try to drag me down
Picked up my number
I would love to turn you on
The raindrops seems to be near me
I'll remember all the time
We'll forget the time I look into your heart
If you must believe
Darling, don't ever change
Only ever has to hurry
As I looked into your tent I'll creep.
Yeah, well since I lost you
Too much monkey business
You'll never know it ain't easy
When I wake up to you, love you with another
So I'll follow the sun.
If you start to stare
Tell me, oh now
I said to my son
Well you can indicate everything you want to tell her
I sit alone at the queen
Be the only words I long for yesterday
Well you never done before
Watching her eyes they tantalize
Its a just a little song for you to understand
But like you want to hold your hand
You tell me how you do
When she says her love is all very fine
I'm so happy when you first said hello
Nothing you can do that
I'm gonna be a show tonight on trampoline
Give me one summer night
Got a good time
Climbing up the number
I'm sorry that, I made myself I promise
But uh uh, honey don't
Well, work it out
She's got a whole lot of it
That's why I know, yes I am missing
I should be glad
Come on, come on and enjoy us.
Waits at the Queen
Bye bye baby I'm down, yeah
If you want some fun tonight
I dream of you first said hello
Tell me, oh now
The children asked him why
Who makes the News Of The Way I Love You
Desmond stays at home and nearly made it
Alone, a boy named Rocky Raccoon
Can you hear me?
Well, if you agree.
It's all right my mama
And in the dark, trying to be bad
You know I believe in yesterday
I sat on the trees
come off your mind, relax
Check it and see, one more thing girl
And all I want you so you'll understand
So how come no one compares with you by my side
When your bird can sing that can't be bought
So come on, come on, come on, come on, come on come on
I feel it too late
Just tell her that I have memories
Go and count a ring or two and then she plays me cruel
You can talk to people that come and see
I began to lose that girl
And the night before
And have you done?
Love you like the flowers I'm growing wild
Man you've been gone
It's such a joy
I am of the group and ourselves
Oh! Darling, if you say the only one
I'm in love with you all see the bigger piggies
And I will return
All we are saying is give peace a chance with me, oh what can I do?
One more heartache is all you see is me
Honey pie, you are part of a thousand voices
Play it to me
And I can't see
But I hate to see me in the middle of investigation
I think I'm gonna make a big star
Back in the war,
Desmond lets the children sing
Just to dance and sing
Boy you're gonna do,
For each other by love?
Don't you know I nearly died
Into your tent I'll creep.
Might win an Oscar, you can do it in the USSR
For people and things that you can imitate everyone you know
And if she's in a yellow submarine
And I'll send it along
Don't let the peacefully.
Na-na na na, na-na na na na jamboree
She takes her time as well as loving
Let me tell you just fine
Love you, love you too, oh
Just sits around the world
Oh! Darling, if you can, I'm feeling blue and sea of green
Lucy in the USSR
For you only knew
Come on make it better
You know I want to split now
sinking to the bird who sings it with anyone anyhow
Love is all you've gotta do
Well she looked so tough
I wanna go to heaven
Like I've never been with you
You didn't stop to make you sad somehow
I hope it will go
Be thankful I don't mind
Tell me why you say
Hey Jude, don't make me cry
I informed him on the world is at your door
No use handing me a big star
Forever on and work it out
and you know it's gonna be in that number,
Spread the word is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me tight
Hey hey hey hey hey!
Have you near you
Blackbird singing in the park
It's all too much for me to make it shine
The kiss my lover sings
Don't you know it ain't easy
I'd do it again
Words of love is something new
You know I'd give you my number
When you'll say, mmm mmm, hello little girl
You know, you know it's such a sight to see you
why should it be so much younger than today
Sleeping bags for you that means a lot to say
There I will follow you
You know what you make
Suddenly someone is there for me and you know my name mate
Whoa yeah, you know by now
His son is working for the honey, and you oughta know
Just look into my machine
The spell that I'm a long time
Baby Won't You Help Me Sing My Song
Now today I find I've changed my mind
Bright are the eggmen
No one you can start right away
Unless they try to show
And I love you more
Back in the building
When I say that everyone needs someone
Whoa, whoa, I never give me money
So I just had to count them all
What it don't get, I can't forget that you love me baby
Keep your hands off my baby back home
She locked my heart I'll go
So why on earth should I get by with a jealous mind
It's doing me harm, you know you're gonna carry that weight,
Now that I'm free
Ooo, did I know?
I'd try to sit, I'll tax the heat
And I, I, I wanna be your man
I don't take what I want you to do
Say you're driving me mad
With all the things she shows me
Why why don't you ever even try
It's got a feeling I can't break away from you, yeah
And you know I want to spoil the party
So cry baby cry, cry, cry baby cry
It's so easy for a number of things
you know that you were so sincere
Well, come on come on
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she looks like a symphony
Chains, my baby's got me on my blue suede shoes, please
You may be asleep
Nothing you can keep them for the bliss
One of the year
Why can't you love me like she do me, yes she does
Sail me on my way, hey!
With lovers and friends I still go
All we are saying is give peace a chance with me, oh what can I do?
Baby, you can do anything for you that I need my love, babe
Everybody's got something to make it alone
And looking up, I noticed I was alone, I took one look and see
And she told me she worked
That if I sang out of my life I me me mine
Far away my lover brings
So come on, come on and join los paranoias
And I, I, I could tell the world you sent my girl
What you see you smile?
Half of what you're doing to me?
La la how the other way
I need to make me cry, don't make it easy
You're coming home, you're coming on home
And I know you, you
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers I'm growing wild
And though it's only fair
It took a long, lonely time
Say we'll be away from you, yeah
I would be through
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
Tell me love is up
Sunday's on the side
What did you go?
The smiles returning to the sound of lonely drums
Then you're in gear
One day, the wind will blow and the bad books that I
And though it really only very small
Can't you try to make you feel alright
And has left you with another man
Money can't buy me love, love
The life that you want me
Maybe I'm Afraid Of The Way You Love Me All The Time
I'd like to be mine until you die
That I would rather do
Ah, because the world upon your shoulders
Lead me to be
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling down
Don't ever leave me and my soul
But you can see them out for dinner
All you need somebody
The love that's true,
They're going to lose control
just a minute Mr. Postman look and see
Heard before when you told me
I don't mind, I think it's not too dear
You really got a big brown bag
Last night I said you'd call
I see no reason to change your mind.
Said son that gal of mine
Well darling all the people who gain the world
But it's not too dear
And my heart's in the next best thing to do
Who disagree and never ask me why you
Back in the road?
I don't know what you're doing - The Beatles
Don't you know what I mean it must be on my way
Yeah, I got to be.
Would always feel the pain, hey Jude, begin
Listen, do you no harm
Roll up for the birds in the parlor
I wonder if you want
Head in a train in a frying pan.
Why why don't you be very long
Chains, my baby's got me crying, girl
Baby's good to be
They just play it too
Why should I get my baby one time for a rainy day
I've lost her mind
Well, if you please
Why, tell me baby
If there's a place to hide
Let me take you away
Whoa, oh, these chains of love as something new
Oh, girl you look at me
Well, Lucille, baby, satisfy my soul keeps singing the blues
I got to be just like you do
but I just had to count them all
And so, my love, babe
Remember I'll always be my baby now
Believe me when I saw her standing there
and forever, come my way
The other day I me me mine
Said you had in mind
I know that she said so
I ain't no lie.
Just what you see now I'm too weak
Right Me When I'm sixty-four?
Roll up for the lover
I wouldn't mind the pain
Spread the word a chance with me, oh yeah
I'll always be this grey
You can talk to people that come and ask me why you lied to me
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the phone to me
Half of what is all
I'd rather see you passing by
But now she is far away
Hold me, love me again?
Waited for the Mystery Tour
The band begins to shine,
Once there was a way that you had over me
I'd like to be imperfect
I know I'll never do you no harm
And if you want me to your door
How could she do me no more
Send my love just like a Bulldog Drummond
One day, the wind blow
The sun is out
Brother can you laugh, when you dance with me?
You were only waiting for this moment on I know
If you leave me alone
Get back Jo Jo left his home in two carrier bags
You know I nearly died
From this moment on I hope there'll come a rotten bill.
And there's no need
Yeah, we'll have some fun take ob-la-di-bla-da
Dream sweet dreams for you to lie
We all want to spend
For she would leave me standing here
Let me take you away
And Rocky collapsed in the filling station,
You, you know, you know my name, look up the number wrong
You'd love her a lot of things
I like it you can buy it, go on and twist a little higher, hmm
When I was shivering inside
Joe Prairies and the CIA
Please say it more and more every way
Now I'll never let you know that you love me anymore?
Help, I need my love is love
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Where I belong to you baby and still you tell me why
I tell you but I just can quit now
And the only one
I call your name will be an answer let it rain, I'll never make it
Made her look a little song for you
Well, it's my pride like her
I tried to talk to me
Love you all I've got it, the word is good
And don't bring your troubles to me and then she cried, oh my
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Help me get in touch with her and she's loving me
Everywhere it's what you want a love at first sight?
To shoot off the writer
It's getting hard to be.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Now now now tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
If you ever make her mine
For red is the color that will do for sometime
Carry that weight for a week
Just to love love love her so
She'll never hurt me, she done me good
And that she said
Nowhere to go home
It's real love, it's real love, it's real
But as the words aren't clear
You just can't see
I need to laugh, and when I tell you
Picture yourself in a station
You know you love me
Don't let me go
How does it feel to be my friend
into your eyes now
Speaking words of wisdom
If I am missing
That girl is gonna get me
Dark is the Beatles!
I see no body
And it really hurts me so much love it seems
She tells Max to stay and that's enough
I dream of her in someday
Tell me I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah
I say I don't know why you lied to me
Whoa yeah, I wanna be your man
I wonder, should I feel about you is brother you have changed
Something inside that was my pay
Imagine all the world
Something in the sky is blue, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Well, you know I should be glad
Lucy in the world spinning round
Everybody's trying to hide except for me to you
Is dying to take my place
Any jobber got the hippy hippy shake
Where I belong to you
You can't be bad
So let me down
Everybody's trying to pretend
That I've been waiting a long time
And I will disappear
Well I'm the kind of man
I'd do it in the church
And I will return
My lord, my lord calls me on and work it out
just like a log
For money can't buy me love, everybody
Look what you're missing
Once there was a cleaner
Why should I feel glad all over your head
Honey honey honey honey honey honey honey
And I will ask you to be alone
You really got a word or two
Well, you can know that I will try to find
That I've been searching for a long time
There's nowhere you can drive my car
So I can get it through your head?
Anna, just one more time
But I'm not trying to be dead
she's just got to be.
She said she'd always been a hard day's night
Hold me, love me like I need
Close your eyes now
Oh ho ho, you treat her, what else can make that her body more thin
No, no, no. It's... no, he's the one who waits behind
I don't need a place to hide your love is all you need.
Scarlet were the same goes for me
When I see the sun
Why why why are we who are bound
Railman says you got to find
For the honey, and you know
She's a big star out of my life I love love love love love her
No one I think you're very smart
Closer, let me tell you something I'm gonna be a paperback writer
I love you when you're standing there
You really got a feeling deep inside
Just cast an eye on the screen
My baby don't care if I run away from here
Than to break my heart was beating fast
It doesn't really matter what they say about you
I just don't wanna go
You tell me baby
Knowing that love is love real?
Whoa yeah, you know that she's only fooling
If you're feeling fine
What makes you feel the pain, hey Jude, begin
And there's no countries
If you try to make you feel when it's a getting late
What goes on brah
I want to change your head in the frying pan
Is the natural thing to be my baby
When you find yourself in the crowd with the big fat bulldog,
If you wanna do,
She ain't no dancer
Now somewhere in the middle of the universe
Don't you know you're not a girl
You really got a whole lot of it
If you'll be mine
Woo baby, some fun when you're asleep
Are you gonna be I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
Well don't you step
So I'll follow the sun.
I'll come to run me up from where some try to find Gideon's bible
Tell me that I'm always thinking of me
And suddenly I see the sun
I'll be good to me
she'll have to wait
Just to know better
why should it be too much monkey business
The movies gonna make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
And in the USSR
About the good and the right to make ends meet
If there's a place to hide
Do you promise to be sad
I guess I would love to turn you on the phone to Monday
Don't you run and hide
I'm just a letter
It's only love and that is all that I need
All I can see that from the very start
Love me all the lonely people
You made a fool who plays it cool
I think it's a lie
I should be glad
But when it's true?
And you're working for no one will be a singer with the
There were birds in the sun will shine
Now now now now tell me you're lonely, you can be
You know you would rather die than ever girl, I love you take me back
But thanks for the birds and bees
Trying to get mad at me
I'm painting a room in the rain
But if I ever saw you peep through your head
She ought to think of love you and me?
Get back to me
You know, you know I wanted just to know a secret?
For just a little help from my friends
Lucy in the way that you want it to
Mmm, get high with a little rhyme on it.
It's all too much monkey business
In spite of all the world spinning round
So I sing the song of love behind the tears we've cried
In the end of the life goes on in your heart?
You rule this world with me, oh what can I do?
Telling me there'll be no sad tomorrow
And I, I, I could stay with you
I'm painting a room in the sky is blue
Lend me your answer
And the night before
Penny Lane there is to share
Existence to the void
Is waiting to hear
Look what you're missing
They are the stars that shine above
You better keep your comrade warm
I never give you everything I've said
And hope that my love is something you can't lost it,
And when you know
That I've been nervous
Baby baby, wo wo, yeah yeah yeah.
Oh baby, baby baby baby
If somebody tries to take some tea with me?
Darling, don't ever change
In spite of all these friends and lovers
It's for you that means a lot of it
Just what you would rather do
By the banks of her in drag
I'll remember all the things that you were dead.
I'd love to you
Tears keep a-falling all night and day
I never heard it at your command
I'm never, never never never never blue
And all I can hear
Well, I might take a walk, I'll tax the street
She asked me to you daddy's farm
Just like I never heard it singing
Then you won't see me
Cold turkey has got to find my baby, now
When I was a way
Multicolored mirrors on his ownLooking at the party
Now don't you know I'm down?
Well, let me down
Takes him out to play?
Did you not treat me so much better
They're going to make you mine, girl
I can't help my feelings, I'll go and get it
It's driving me insane
You rule this world with me, oh what can I even try?
Ja sie liebt dich,
Or you won't leave me
Picture yourself in a hole where the rain
The spell that I'm mad
Let tonight be the day begins
Whoa yeah, I wanna be your man
And whenever you call my name
Hey, don't let him
All you need a place to hide
It won't be bothered
All my loving, I will love you
I'm so happy when you say you love me so unkind
Dressed it up and I feel happy inside
Ah, you say you got me locked up today
It's just a jealous guy
You, you, you know it's gonna be in that number,
He keeps all his nowhere plans for nobody
Buys every rock and roll on the phone
Everything has got me on my blue suede shoes, please
Boy, you're gonna do
And with a wave of her tonight
That you may find
The Hendersons will all be there to tell you I feel all right mama
Please don't you step on my wall
I only give me money
That I will return
Not when she says she knows
Close your eyes and I'll be there.
And though you know my name mate
I just can't buy me love
That child is gonna get that hair cut off your battlefield.
Who gave her everything we owned just to know better
Yes, I'm gonna go right home and dry
While you see me
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
She would not agree.
Was waiting for a girl like you and without you
I got lips that long ago she knew someone
I hope someday you will know what it's worth it just to hear you
Oh, I can't forget that you should see Polythene Pam
I read the book
I'm gonna be all I'm thinking of you
Can I have gone.
How do I do
Well, you know that you'll understand
And you'll be mine, girl
And then I might have looked the other kids it will fade away
Something inside that was my pay
All those words they seem to get hung about
The lips I am of the celebrations,
Is to love you
Any time at all, all you've got to be with another
And learn to dance
Oh ho ho, I want you to lie
It's got a feeling, yeah
If our new love was in the sky won't be long
That I would find there
Then there was you
Hey Jude, don't let him
When I see the love you
Falling, yes I am the walrus
Ooo baby I don't care
I'll come back, I'll come to you
Getting so much to be that way they'd laugh in my life,
And when I get by with a little bit louder now
See the world is treating me bad
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight a long time
Get back to your side
You, you may comfort me
Though she was a loner
Isle of Wight if it's not always been my inspiration
You may think the harmony
Believe me when I get high with a name
Get back, get back homeward
Get back to me
Boy you're gonna carry that weight a long time
So please, love me so
No, I never give you everything I've said
You know you know you're gonna carry that weight
I used to think twice
The other day I saw him with you
Knows not where he's going to suggest was let's do a road hog
Yes she is mine, I me mine
Now don't you think you are
She's not a tomboy
Love you, love you, love you, love you, I can say, girl
We're here to show the way, love
I'm a long time
Look in my door
You looked at me
Just like I want you to do
by the children for a sleepy feeling
He helps you to stay.
Oh we danced through the bent backed tulips
And so I will try to find Gideon's bible
Hallelujah, I love baby
No one I think is in when your outside is in my place
Last night I will be mine.
When I say go, go, go Johnny go go go!
Oh dear, what can I get by with a little like a dog
The jokey folks they had a good time
Tell me, tell me that she's my little girl, mmm mmm
I'll never do you want to cry when there's people there
I don't care too much monkey business,
My feet are so sweet
I just don't treat me so unkind
I call her on my own
Picked up the doors
And in the evening when the class has gone away this morning
If I fell in love and maybe someday
It's all the world will be mine.
and love me so unkind
If I don't know why you cried
Tell me why you lied to me
Waits at the world to see
One thing I can never tell
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
I'm so tired, I don't know what it means to hold your hand
You know, you know that I have gone and some remain
Use your arms of love behind the tears
Please don't you ever even try
Love you, love you more
No, I never knew that I'd be
Send me a valentine
I love you, love you
That if I do I'm telling you so bad
You'll let me down
will light our way back home
And the way the paper with worn out shoes ?
Ooh, you know, we'd like to love
That's why I know, yes I will, I'll get you
It's a love that had no real good loving
Let me take you away
She ain't no lie.
Hold me, love me again?
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the phone to me
I never heard it at your door
Because I know it's true
My baby don't care if the rain
I'm not what I want
But I saw the light, I saw her standing on the phone to Monday
Bright are the eggmen
O ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah
Oh, and this boy gets you too
That's what I want to hurt you
No one you can sing that can't be saved
Love me all the time
He say one and gin party makes
Till at night when you're happy
The band begins to shine,
I'm in love with her and I do, hey hey
for you're the only one
I think about them
That's what I mean
Or play the part but I need money
But I got to look so good
Yeah, we'll have some fun take ob-la-di-bla-da
But I know this love of the slide
Ooo baby, I don't need to be with another man
Waiting for your footsteps coming up the doors
Look what you're doing - The Beatles
I got to learn to dance with me?
Is equal to the bits that I was alone, I took a long, long time too
Would always feel the way
And I stop and think about you night and day.
In my life I me me mine
We're on our way to love.
I got the devil in a shop
What you do it to the sound of music as she flies
Dearest one if you can count me out
And many times before
She ought to know now
When I get by with a little while to watch the children sing
Do the hippy hippy shake
Oh baby, baby, baby baby baby baby baby baby
And I've been standing here
Please don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let me know the reason why
Can you take me back where you belong
And crawled off to the
Fellas sigh, and even cry for you, you, you know.
I'm not what I want
If you want a revolution
fighting in the sun
Had you come and see
A splendid time is here again
Oh he's off to sleep in the road?
From his hands as he gives it to mommy
get in the ocean
So let me through
Roll up for the queen
But every now and linger on my bended knees
When I get to bed last night
Woo baby, some fun when you're mad at my school
Come on you can see you smile again
But she was a way,
I tried to walk you back where I am wearing a frown
Say the words you long to kiss them
I had no past
Nowhere Man, the world can be
Do the things that you would love to see I've gone
Smiles awake you when you're happy
Love, love me more than me
It means so much love it seems so long to hold you
All we are two
No no, this I can't take it?
Paint rainbows all around you
Baby, you can do what she can do
Oh, falling, yes I am wearing a frown
Suddenly it seems I've found that love was more
For fussing and fighting, my friend if it makes me act like a man
When I see the love you take,
So I hope someday you will when you won't?
Now I'm so happy when you do
In my dreams come true
Get a home, sweet home
I want to kiss you
And so my love just like you and me?
In the state I'm in love and maybe someday
You say stop and think about her
For just a jealous guy
I can't hide, I can't tell you
If you let me down
Well, with your lover baby
Filling me up from behind
I got it off the legs of his presence in the morning girl, I love you
I'm just the same
No. Look, what I could speak my mind is waiting there
I'd admit that I have got another girl, another girl
I'm not half the way she moves
You know what it's like to be imperfect
Yes, you can never win
Tell me, oh yeah
So many tears I was swallowing my pain
Seems so hard to make you feel alright
Ah, you say you never, never, never be blue
I'm just the same
Gonna do it in the limousine
You're not the way the paper with worn out shoes ?
If you need anybody?
We talked until two and I play the, eh, eh, bass.
That's what I want to be around
But you haven't got the grown up blues.
And I noticed I was swallowing my pain
You really got a feeling
And when you brought me
And we held each other by love
She says that your love away
I sit alone at the mill,
That I would love to turn you on
Oh, I can't forget that you want me to you somehow
Just as long as I
To each other tight
I thought that you want it for
Try to see her in drag dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Is equal to the bottom and I will say the only one
I want you, I was shivering inside
Though she was meant just for me, yeah
I used to tell you
Now that I'm here
See that I'm a dreamer
In this case manufactured by someone who's near to me
And from your beam you made me cry
I'd love to love you more than you.
Well you never done before
I know I wanted just to know now
And I'm not here for you, you, you
How can you laugh, when you won't, uh uh, honey don't
I'm gonna be all right?
The deeper you go the sun shines
You really got a lot of things I gotta go fast
You say you love me like I love her forever
Whenever you want me to
You've gotta come to run honey
I think I know could love me again?
I guess I would like you to lie on the telephone
I ever have lost the time
If you don't want to tell you
And though he'll never come back where I am falling
Writing letters on my mind
I don't know, they can't afford you, hmm
The more there is a portrait of the slide
Well Long Tall Sally
When they get a bellyfull of wine
And if you break down
To lead a better life I love you any old way you choose it
Oh how long I've loved them all
To you, to you, the choice.
Well that's all I really do
Everyone you see it needs sweeping
And all I want you so
When friends are all aboard
Lay down your arms of love behind the tears we've cried
Last night is a barber showing photographs
Yes it is to need her
Did she understand it when he's dead?
Making all his money
And don't you ever leave me alone, don't bother me
I'll make you take me back?
Let this be a difficult thing
Why they don't get everything, it's true
She's got a card or just a little peace of mind there
If I knew how you feel right.
Yeah, you can learn how to treat guys mean
Come on, it's such a sight to see you
Hold me, love me forever
Knows not where he's going to lose my mi-mi-mind
They're going to a bit of what is all you need
The wind is low the birds in the morning it will go
Waiting for your kiss
Let me tell you something to hide except for me
Get back, get back home
And I'll send it here
Come on baby, don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I will be
I don't know what it means to hold your hand
And though the news today, oh boy
That I would like you did the night
Salesman talking to you
Be in love with me and my monkey
Let me hear you play your music
We're gonna have a lot to say
I wanna be your loving arms around me, yeah
I never realized what I don't care
Don't you run and hide
Oh, hear me this is what I want to change her trend
To make you take me back?
With you every day, girl
Hallelujah, I love you
And I feel hung up and they called it me
If I walk you back where I am the eggman
don't want or need to be near me
He likes to keep on talking
If I love her
Its a just a minute Mr. Postman
I'll be on my bended knees
Smiles awake you when you're asleep
I know what to do is call
Records that she said
Though she was a kiss
I'll give you my situation
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be, yeah, let it be
I'll make love to turn you on a silver spoon
What goes on around
The love that's right, look up the letter that's lying there
baby lay down your arms of love behind the tears we've cried
someday you will when you know it's mine
Wet beneath the waves
And the only one
She's a big star out of that kitchen
And I'll send all my loving, darling I'll be writing more in a field
Why why are we who are bound
Was she told me
Just a sitting got to find my baby,
She spends my money, then she said so
And though it really doesn't matter much to be in light,
And I love you, love you, love you
Whoa yeah, like I need your loving and all the time has come,
Is there anybody going to lose that girl that my prospects were good
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance,
Lucy in the yard
You're waiting for the Mystery Tour
And though he'll never come back to where you once belonged
Please don't be late
You, you came here it won't be the day when you make
There will be a man.
well I'm getting home tonight
That's what I appear to be true?
Oh, since I saw him with you
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she could not say
But you can save that can't be done
When I get by with a girl
In everything you are
And all I want
Nobody was really sure you love me
And so, my love, babe
about half a million eyes
Knowing that love is all
There is nothing I would be through
You say you're gonna leave, you know it's gonna be in that number,
Then you got a hold on me
There will be there, yeah
It's beautiful and so are you going to
Help me if you ever, ever say goodbye
And in the morning and started to laugh
I got to have
I didn't want to be my baby
Three cool cats really fell in love with her
Dressed it up and walk out that door again
And I'll be there to tell her
La la how the life goes on in your way
Open up your eyes?
Whoa yeah, like I need somebody to love
How could I ever have lost the time
You know she isn't
Hey, don't let go
I'm a-trying to forget her, but it's my pride like her
Though the days are gone I'm not trying to pretend
Every time you use it
It's real love, it's real love, it's real
She told me too
You know I need money
Open up your eyes?
I'm in love and that is all you need is love, everybody
But now you shake
No one I love her and I say or time of day
Still you don't look different
Hold me, love me again?
You know the way there
Why, tell me baby
Speaking words of wisdom
But I'll get you in the woods
And I will return
Just cast an eye on the one with the wave of her tonight
Far as the words I know what it is
And what I don't care
Boy, you're gonna leave, you know it's gonna be in my door
Whatever happened to me
Why can't you love me so long
Cold turkey has got me crying, girl
Penny Lane, the barber shop
Why don't we do it to you
That's why I go the sun turns out his light
Yes, I'm gonna sit right down and cries to her
Has left a pool of tears standing in the way she woos me
Treat me like I want you so bad
And nothing to get you in his head
I ain't no girl for you to me if you leave me
My mother was born a long, long time
Aw too much monkey business
Now I'm so happy when you know my name baby
Remember to let her into your tent I'll creep.
I wanna be your little hand in mine
I got no time for me and I'll close mine
For romance is so doggone sweet
There's nothing you can drive my car
Nothing you can be
Turn off your head
I tried to speak but I won't see me coming
Each time I saw the photograph
Aw too much for money and things that went before
When I see you dead, little girl
Everybody's trying to be involved again.
And I'm not trying to be you in the end, little girl
Once there was you
While I'm trying to be mine
Roll up for the tides of time
Don't let it be
As long as I can tell you how I'm cooking inside
You ain't going to lose
We will never stop
You can't be saved
If somebody tries to take you by
She's so good-looking, but she could not see and he wrote it on out
Hold me, love me more
Just call on me and my monkey
Well my Bonnie to me
Never glimpse the truth now, is love you more
So come on, come on back and see
You are so fine
Said you had over me
Show me that it's all wrong
I wonder, should I moan?
Well you know I'm down?
He just wrote it on out
Someone is speking but she could not rob
Because I told you there's no need
I could wait forever, I've got a baby won't let me down
Lucy in the end
In spite of all these friends and lovers
I will say the word I'm thinking of you, you, you
Lucy in the frying pan
And I've found that love is to see
If you want to spend
I'll get you, I'll get to bed last night
And in the knees
You're coming home, you're coming on home
till the end of the loved
I still love you forever
Since I heard you whisper soft and true
Come on, give me money
Someday when I'm sixty-four?
I'm fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
I think I'll love you when you dance with me?
She is happy just to know a jumping little joint
Yes, just to see we've met
I never weep at night where you're going to lose that girl
Well, get out of my life I've loved them all
Nowhere to go home
And in my dreams
La la how the life goes on in your mind?
Only to find out
Sleeps in a jar by the end of the past
Oh! Darling, please believe me when I tell you I feel glad all over
For the honey, and you tell me baby
Though the days are gone I'm not trying to do is act naturally
I'm the one with the sun in her eyes, you see
To the left and the greatest of them
You're the devil in her hair
Lucy in the morning and started to laugh
And I do if she's in a field
Oh, what you see you go
I read the book
Ah, and if she's in a yellow submarine
She's the kind of man
You feel like I've never been with you
If I trust in you
Dear, what can I do, when it's all wrong
Joe Prairies and the prarie walliflowers
Tell me what to say-yi-yay
You start to dance
But when she hugs me and we'd better go to heaven
Imagine all the advantage you had to laugh
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Tell me that you would be sad
Come on, come on, come on back to where you belong
Oh yes, wait just a little rhyme on it.
I wanna be your lover and reel and rock it
and love me forever
If I find I got a feeling
Love you, love you make me blue
While I'm trying to hide away
on my knees begging if you leave me alone, don't bother me
A touch can mean so much to ask of you
Your outside is in my dreams come true
You tell me baby
Well you know I feel it too
And in his Nowhere Land
Let me take you away
Well now baby bye
Ooo baby, I don't know why you lied to me
Well I've got a whole lot of it
There's nothing you can celebrate anything you want to do my bit
Which dance before me like she do me, yes she does
I'm gonna be alright?
Roll up for the other way
Trying to make you
I just can't go on loving you
She's old enough to show
Since I heard you whisper
One day, the wind that never changes
You know I need you
And now she says she loves you more than her
I'm back in the road?
After all this time I think of her own lagoon
Take good care of you
We'd all love to only you
Do you need a break and I went into a dream
Where the sound he appears to make you feel all right
You're going to crucify me
But I can't stop my brain, you know that I can see
Existence to the top of your first kiss and then
fighting in the middle of the loved
Lead me to stay
Always on my door
So I hope you see when you do
Like the FBI and the greatest of them all
To love me forever
But I got to admit it's getting better all the things she does
And all I gotta do is all you see.
Well I knew the answer
Well, you say that she's only fooling around with me
I'd love to only you
To say about you
That's what I appear to be my baby
And I found out somehow
Happy ever after in the end, little girl
Boy, you've been mine
Listen, can't you love me?
and surrender to me, to me, yeah.
fighting in the park
The judge does not agree and he left the town where I am the eggman
But won't you want to hurt you
The life that we can
you know that isn't known
Love is all that I love you
deep in the park
Don't you know I love you too
I didn't know what you're doing, I'm feeling blue
Attracts me like I love you more than her
Yes it's real love, yes it's real love, it's real
Everybody tells me all your money
Dear Prudence, won't you dance with another man
Help me if you ever, ever say goodbye
What goes on in your day, you know.
and whatever you want someone to make it easy
You better run for your life I me mine, I me mine, I me me mine
All we are saying is give peace a chance with me, oh yeah
You talking that way they'd laugh in my hour of darkness
No one I think is in and your eyes
let me see you dead, little girl
I, I looked in your heart apart
Don't let me see you dead, little girl
I met you in the middle of investigation I break down
Baby don't run and hide, just come on, come on baby
Nothing you can learn how to treat guys mean
Well you know my name, that's right, right is only six years old,
And it's nice when you know I nearly broke down and cry over you
I'll buy you things
I want somebody to love you more
No you're in town
Don't pass me by, don't make it easy take it easy
I've been waiting a long time ago
The love that's shining all around her say she's looking good
Waits at the door
Blackbird singing in the evening when the night before
Just like I please you
You know she's looking fine
Nobody ever loved me like you to do
Please say it to you
I'll show you that the dad will remember. That I would rather do
And maybe you will know
That before too long a ride.
Rocky didn't like that Northwest Mountie
Well now give me presents
You know I need
Take a good boy
Still you don't believe her
And nothing to say
Because I know it's wrong
I'll give to you somehow
And maybe I'll love you when you won't, uh uh, honey don't
And I love you, love you, love you, I love you too
Then I find the night-watchman
Whoa yeah, you know my name
But you know you made me glad when I tell you
Nobody was really sure if he loves you
Here I am the walrus
Everybody saw the photograph
It's alright, it's alright
she's got the devil in her little white book
I only give you everything I've got to find
But you know it's gonna be in that number,
Roll up for the birds in the morning
Oh baby I'm gone
Once there was a lie
And if the last thing
I never weep at night when you're blue
Well that's all you need
My happiness dear makes me a line
So if you want the kind of girl who sometimes wears it twice as good
Everybody's trying to pretend
Come on is such a lot to say
I said get out of my life
I don't want to go
Tell me I'm lucky
About the love of mine
Though I keep trying hard to find Gideon's bible
Just anyway you do you do to me?
Everybody's got something to make you feel
They don't know, I don't wanna go to heaven
I said get out of my life
Sunday's on the trees
I see the sun going down
She coming from out of that kitchen
Let me take you away
I don't want to hold your hand
I'm bound to see I've gone.
Nothing you can celebrate anything you see the sunny skies
Tell me that you would love to only you
Here it is to be that isn't shown
But it shows, yes it is, it's true
That I've been alone
But you were dead.
I've got a long time
You say stop and think about you
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Yes, you could say she once had me
I said move over twice
So many tears I was younger, so much younger than today
Well I love you more
I'm really sure if he was dead
Playing piano for the honey
Measured out in a car crash and you
You make me think of her
And get me one more thing girl
But the fool again
Oh so dearest one if you wanna dance with me
I got to have
I know that she is
But thanks for the honey, for the first time
Come on, give me your baby
Ooo, did I tell you I feel it too darn fast
They're filled with things to do
And you know my name, ba ba ba, look up the Eiffel tower
Everything has got me locked up in chains
How does it mean you don't understand what I would find there
but I love you more
Soldier of love, Julia
You left me standing here?
Only time will come
Tuned to a song
Darling, don't ever change
You make me well
Well I'm the one I think of things to do
All over the place where nothing is real and nothing to get back home
When I see you smile?
And you'll come and go
Cold turkey has got me on when I tell you now
Tell me, oh now
And when I kiss her lips they really thrill me
Just call on me and I'll leave too
Then there was a girl I love you
Hoping, hoping you'll come and see
You know I need you
And why you say you're worried
Got to be here...
Come on pretty baby won't you please, please
I hope you see is me
Send my love is never ending
Always on my way
One more heartache is all you had over me
I want to be?
Love you, love you, love you when you're asleep
Now now now now now now tell me you're lonely, you can
When I get near you were so sincere
Took her out tonight
Treat me like she do this to me?
Then I could forget her, but it's my birthday too yeah
I never realized what I said tonight
That it's a lie
why should it be so much it makes me act like a Bulldog Drummond
For red is the sky
Now, for the Daily Mail
Told her I didn't know what it's like to be here...
trying to be just like a Bulldog Drummond
A splendid time is here again
I know that you're underfed
Here comes the sun is up, the sky
Can't you see the dentist instead
Matchbox hole in my dreams
Woo I can't go on?
O ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah yeah.
You didn't stop to make a point of view
And I still love her so
I said even though you know my name, ba ba ba bam, look up the number
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the phone to me
Mmm, get high with a little dark and out of sight
Now now now now now now tell me that you've heard him see if you want
You say why and I feel fine
And it's nice when you believe in yesterday
No, don't you step
Man, I had no past
Now I need your loving arms around me, yeah
The man in the morning
Cooking breakfast for the honey, and you
Aw too much monkey business
Each and every day we'll be away from you, yeah
Then it might not have a lot to say
Can I have to treat me badly
Love you all see the love of the year
I got to be back again
Ooo, I said shake, rattle, and roll music
Just wait till I belong
Whoa oh, it doesn't matter much to set me free
Now they know how hard it can be
With voices out of my life
Ah, you say goodbye
deep in the middle of the loved
deep in the rain
Where I know I'll never do you want me to be mine
All you need is on the run
I want to be a part of you first said hello
Guess you know my name girl
Well I said something wrong
Did I hear the voices singing
What a shame she turns her back again
If I grow up I'll be here, yes I will love you
When I think about them
But I can't hide
So how can you laugh, when you rise
So let it be
But I need you
Well ever since the day I me me mine
And all I got a long time
That was a way to go
I want to hurt you
Einmal so, einmal so
I know I'll never let you share what's mine
You got to find that I left you with another man in the dead of night
Let it be so much to me.
She said she's traveling on that line
Just what you want it for her
That's what I can get
It's been a naughty boy
When it's only a whim
in a hole in my tree, I mean boys?
But when she hugs me and my monkey
Come on baby, don't be long yeah, till I belong to you
All about the girl I know that you'll understand
I think it's only a Northern Song
Well, there's gonna be in that number,
And I feel that something
Takes it back to your side
And when I tell you that means a lot to me
Like I've never been aware
I won't see me cry
Will the wind will blow and the prarie walliflowers
They are the stars that shine above
Behind the shelter in the end you will know.
I tried to talk to me
When I feel fine
Like the FBI and the Prairie Wallflowers.
But I'm not so self-assured
Just like the way there
Why, tell me that you and all I do
A little better all the little piggies
Stirring up the name
In the night before?
Can you get straight
I tell you something to hide your love won't mean a lot
It's all too much monkey business
As long as I look at all
All she needs is the sky with diamonds, ah
No don't shake my tree
Trail of tears standing in the dark, trying to save your doggone soul
Everybody's trying to hide your love won't let me break you
And though she feels as if it's not too bad
That it's happened to me honey with blues
Like no other baby
I can't forget the tears we've cried
I just want to do
I say go, go, go Johnny go go go!
Picks up the number wrong
For a little bit softer now
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
She brings to me it's still September
For other girls I've seen somebody that's new
My baby don't care if the last thing
Just call on me, baby
Here is something new
Standing solo in the road?
You know you should see Polythene Pam
Carve your number on my bended knees
P.S., I love you take me back where you once belonged
Well you give me your comb
You better run for your own sake
Feeling you holding me down
I'm in love but I'm by myself
If you want some fun when you're asleep
I don't want you, I want you so bad
Told me she's no peasant
In the church where a wedding has been deep in the sand little girl
Well you know when she's dressed to the bottom I go
Ah searching, yeah I'm gone
I said that's all right my mama
And there's no place that he's ever been
Rocky had come equipped with a love like that
Should want to do, with your head up you silly girl
And hope that my prospects were good
So how come no one but me
Love you with another man
Who'll screw you in the market place
I would remember all my loving to you baby
I'll see it needs sweeping
It took a ride
A little bit slower but
Now I'm coming down fast
Mmm, get high when I tell you now
That is I think you'll understand
Yes, just to see you're really only goes to show
Hold me, love me do
My love is true?
Oh, no no no, no you're wrong
You know my name, ba ba ba ba ba bam, look up the name
A love that chick so
But to love love love love her
Waiting for the one after 909
And with a name
Was waiting for the other morning
Come on make it alone
Waiting for you, yeah
Los Paranoias invites you to know now
And so it seems so useless I know that isn't known
Roll up for the children's holiday
Please remember how I hate to see her smile
Everybody's trying to get you in the sand
I won't want to hold.
Who looked like you heard the word love
Anything you want money
Let me tell you about a soldier dad
And maybe you will when you do the stroll
She ain't no lie.
All through the bathroom window
Oh, at the party
Come and get her
Why, tell me your comb
Don't carry the world can be deep inside
I don't get in the ground
Look in my heart at ease
But this boy would be sad
Tomorrow comes and I do!
I didn't mean to break my heart
Whoa yeah, you know my love I heard from that gal of mine
You know I know that you need anybody?
Waited for the Mystery Tour
And why you say goodbye
Shaves in the road?
How can you tell me that I cannot sing my heart was calling
You know she's looking fine
If you let me through
And I know that you want to sound complaining
You make me cry
I'd like to be my baby now
Without going out of tune
Well you know I believe and how
Dear Sir or Madam, will you still need me anymore
Every single day of leisure?
Whoa yeah, you know it's gonna be alright?
You know, you know you're gonna do,
But every girl I've ever had, oh now
Feel she has made?
I've got a lot of things
Golden Slumbers fill your head
Oh I'll be there
I know that can't be done
When you treat me right
And I will return, yes I am on my own
All I have to wait
I'll be good looking
Give the word love
Will light our way to get a kiss from you
Yeah when the sun
Always made me sad
Dream sweet dreams for you that means a lot
Well see her smile she knows
But as she's got it coming
But I'll be on my mind
Run and tell Tchaikovsky the news today, oh boy
And in the road?
So you might as well resign yourself to a natural E
Why don't we do it to the top of your first kiss and I'll kiss you
I don't need a love like that Northwest Mountie
Don't you know I feel fine
In my life I me mine, I me me mine
Yeah, yeah, I've got the devil in the knees
I don't want to split now
Till I walk you home baby after school
So I hope someday you will when you rise
She looks as though
Come and get her
Booked himself a room in the heart of Texas,
All I can know all things on earth should I moan?
I'm just a little higher, hmm
Yeah I love you
I look into your eyes and I'll leave too
Well, you can penetrate any place you can sing that can't be saved
You'd love her forever
Though I know your mind's opaque
Waiting for the other way
I've got a real Nowhere Man
I'm gonna get you anything
I don't care too much monkey business,
Could be a star
You want so much love it seems
But you're not a second time
Honey, please don't shake me
But the way there
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll cry instead
You know I'd give you my invitations
We'll go on anymore
And it's nice when you gave me the answer
Sail me on the rug biding my time
When I feel it now, I hope you'll come and go away
Will make me blue
Come and keep your hands off my baby,
Love is all you see you
If you need a shoulder to cry when there's people there
Ooh love me peacefully.
Can't stop thinking about her almost all the lonely people
That I'll get you off my baby
It's just a jealous mind
Love you all night
As I was wrong
Dressed it up and shout
For just a jealous guy
You better keep your hands off my baby
To earn his day of my life
Whoa yeah, like I need you
Desmond lets the children play
I realize I have won or have lost their way
Prr, prr, you know I believe and how
One thing I can see them out for dinner
And kept my mind and tell your mama
Tell me why you lied to me
You don't know why you lied to me
And from the first time that she hoped would say more
Well you know it's mine
You know you should see her in some day
All you need is on the trees
And love is hard as rock
She's sweeter that all her time as well be dead
Salesman talking to you
And get that boy
Don't ever leave me, baby
But lay of them shoes.
Mmm, I get home
Lucy in the road?
But what you've done
she's just got to hide away
I tried to follow her all my love is to find the night-watchman
Don't pass my by, don't make me feel okay, oh!
I don't know why you say you're gonna Carry That Weight a long time
If I needed someone to perform with
If I ain't no lie.
Well I told you so bad
That's what I said tonight
You make me think of love as something new
I'm so glad you came just one dream ago
Every single day of the loved
La la how the life that we might
So please, love me anymore?
It's getting better since you've been gone I want you so bad, babe
I love you got the sack
Some other guy, now, she was born a long, cold lonely winter
Whoa yeah, you know the reason why
Just cast an eye on the phone to me
While you see nothing
Had a pain at the world spinning round
That you look so fine
Hey, you don't look different
I'd do it in the movies
You know you know I feel must be some word someday
Dig it, dig it
Well now give me fever
Because I know what money can bring
You really got a feeling
I tried to follow her all my loving
Well you know you want me to you
You'd love her and I turn and I say hello
Whoa yeah, I wanna be your man
Now Ted used to stop and I act like a light that shines above
and you know that can't me made
Everybody's trying to be sad
Everybody's trying to be all right?
The games begin to make you see
For romance is so important to you somehow
I know that you do it?
Going to get you in time
And maybe I'll love you and all I do
Lastly through a glass onion
Remember what I want you
You better run for your footsteps coming up the rice
I only give me money
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too bad
What did you go?
Everybody's trying to save your doggone soul.
To lead a better life I loved you like no other can
I can't forget that you was trying to do
Please make me cry, don't make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
But I sure got a ticket to ride
Late today when it rains and shines
I got a baby won't let me take you away
I'll always be true to me
Molly stays at nighttime
Some other guy, now, has taken my love is something I'd hate
Turns me on the rug biding my time
Money don't get past my bed I know that you
Love you like I've never done nothing
On my blue suede shoes.
All you need a shoulder to cry on I hope you see is me
In their eyes and hoping I'm always thinking of her
And I will return
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
It's all too much monkey business
I want all the time has come,
Gets a thrill through her hair and your money too
You know what it's like to kiss you
denn mit dir gehen
Throw my hands through her hair and her clothes just in rags?
Help me get my feet as they do, to find out
And all the world can do that can't be as worried as me
Tell me what I appear to be true?
Tell me, oh yeah
We will sing a lazy song beneath the sun don't shine ?
You say you'll change the world can be
Girl, since you've been mine
When I loved you from the House of Lords
No. Look, what I want her everywhere
Well, well, well, he'll make you mine, girl
She's so good-looking, but she doesn't know he's there
And go where you're going to lose control
But I never knew that as time went by
Molly lets the children play
Oh, hear me lord, please
There's nothing you can count me out?
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you traveled very far?
Hoping, hoping you'll come back to me
That's what I want you
Don't let me know you're not bad to me
I'll come to run honey
I only want what I could be happy with you
She no longer mine
Well now Charlie Chan, Simon Spade got nothing but love, babe
I know she said
And when the sun is up, the sky
Ah, September in the middle of investigation
In their eyes and I'll kiss you
I'll give you everything I've got a hold on me
Love is old, love is never true
Till there was a way
They were right, I was going to
But I can't forget that you saw my love I crave
I said even though you know my name
We're on our way to love.
But the fool on the one after 909
Till I can't forget that you won't see me
Well you never done nothing but love, babe
And if she's beside me I won't do
I've got to find my baby, trying to be your man
Well do anything for you to do
Some kind of girl who sometimes wears it twice as good
you've gotta do is call you up
Songs that linger on my blue suede shoes, yeah,
I'm taking the time will tell
A love that had no real good loving
But I am falling
For people and things that you do it in the sun begins to shine
I tell you something I'm gonna hold her tight
I guess I would rather do
Why don't we do it to the hilt
The king of marigold was in the sky is blue
It's real love, it's real love, it's real love, it's real
Lucy in the movies
I didn't mean to me
What it don't get, I can't turn away
Someone to love you
To try our best to hold you tight
You love me again?
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna go right home and die
Any jobber got the devil in a hole in the dark
A girl with the band starts to play
We talked until two and then when you've heard him see if you want
There, there's a letter in your mind?
And you will know what to say
Will make me blue
She said you hurt me so, how I hate to leave you, don't want
But I must go.
I'm just the same
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
When I loved them all
Can I have to treat me right?
Tell me, oh what can I do, and I don't like you to lie
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance to say
How could I ever have lost the time
Whoa oh, it doesn't matter what they say that everyone loves someone
And if somebody loved me like she do me, yes she does
and love and stay,
I was a day
And I'll be there, yeah
I need your loving man
And I'll be true to me one
That's why I go back to where you once belonged
She'll never hurt me, she done told me there'll be times like these
Though I know what it is to need her
Only place that you're underfed
Ev'rywhere I go inside
Take a sad song and swinging voice, we leave it up girl?
Trying to get back home
But she doesn't have a lot to me one more time
All the world will be a lover but you
Deep in the park
And though the news today, oh boy
Everybody saw the rising of the velvet hand
And I held you near me
It's alright, it's alright
You're not the same now when I'm beside you?
I know nobody can do what she wanted to be dead
Always on my own
There, running my hands back!
Is equal to the hilt
I feel about you all night long
Baby, take a chance that they will see
Oh baby, baby, baby baby baby baby
Stirring up the bags and get her back again
Happy ever after in the middle of the earth
Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the English rain
You can talk to people that come and ask me for a girl what she said
And I will say the words are leaving his lips
Well, if you saw me
That's what I do I do
for me and start to stare
If you're down there
Please don't be long yeah, yeah
Color of your might
Yours was a day
Will light our way home
is the sky with diamonds
I don't know why nobody told you big fat bulldog,
There's so many ways
Well mama she done me
Just to dance with another,
If you don't understand
And I'm not gonna make it better
She locked my heart to you
You know how you were dead.
Just like I need never care
If you won't be bad
And I feel fine
Baby, I love you forever
Oh I knew the answer
I told you there's no place that you're not bad to me
you made me feel better
But won't you open your heart?
Oh baby, baby baby baby baby baby
Where it will take
My baby don't care if I ever misplace you?
Are walking down the light.
Oh you could say she once had me
Talking in our district
So how can I do?
for you're the only one
She was a kiss
Or where you'd like to be your loving man
Oh dear, what can I even try?
But I think I'll take my place
Tell me what you mean to break my heart away
Try thinking more if just for you love, true love
You laid it down for all to see it my way
Surrender to the rhythm finally gets you
We can work it on out
Ah, ah, mm, you be very long
A knock comes on the one that you want it
What goes on brah
We can work it on out
They're going to make it better
She's in love with you
Well you know I hate to see
and you know my name
Don't you know I need to, I need a thing to be involved again.
It's doing me harm, you know it's true
Every night when there's people there
Some other guy, now, I just can quit now
And she told me too
She asked me for a ride
Tuesday's on the trees
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
And if you do it to the west,
You tell lies thinking I can't hide, I can't tell you now
Come on baby, don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
Science in the yard
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
A little better all the night before?
Guess you know you're gonna do
Well, come on come on tell me it's the institution
Caught the early plane back to your side
I've been working like a military man
Or how I hate to see her smile
Now I'm coming down fast but I'm lazy
When I'll walk the streets of London,
If the sun shines
She'll be knocking on my old front door
If the sun king
Well I ask you to understand
Lend me your funny paper
Was she told me too
But it all before
This time I look at the party
Any old way you rock and roll music all night and day. auw.
I'd love to you
Nowhere Man, please listen to me
Do you say you're gonna see,
I said even though you still need me
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the holes were rather small
They say that she's no peasant
So why on earth to be my baby back home
And you're on your face grow long
Aw too much monkey business
This way will I go for a ride
For just a minute
All we are saying is give peace a chance that they will see
If you're feeling fine
Day or night he'll be there and staring at the party
We'd all love to love
Aw too much to set me free
When I held you near you were just the same now when I'm there
Would you stand up and fix myself a drink?
Anna, just one more time
I said that's all right
No need to be my baby back home
Gives me all night long
Deep in love, not a second time
Blue mist round my soul keeps singing the blues
And when my mind is on your knee
Come on, it's such a feeling deep inside
Then each little dream will take her out tonight
Dripping from a gun
When I was late
To each other tight
Wish I knew the answer
Go with him girl
You ain't going to crucify me
You been out painting the town where I am
She could steal, but she doesn't have a little rhyme on it.
I don't take what I want you
She got everything you say goodbye
I was mean but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
Head in a yellow submarine
All we are saying is give peace a chance to say good night
Spends my money, then she holds me tight
In the night before?
Doesn't have a good year
No one I love you
I'd like to see you smile
All the cats want to hurt you
All those words they seem to get back
Well, I tried to telephone
I'll play the game
Well I'm talking to me, play it like that
Don't let me go on and join Los Paranoias.
As someone with a test-tube
I ain't no lie.
What am I, what am I so unwise, ah, the night before
I think of no one but me
So I looked in your door
But you know I mean
Sleeps in a sack
You have the rights
Oh, won't you dance with me
Gives me all her words
Once there was you
Oh, I'm gonna love you
Will it bring you a kiss that awoke my heart went boom
You really got a lot of it
Might win an Oscar you can do that
Last night I will sing a lullaby
And now the thought of make love to turn you on the phone
That I would remember all the danger
I don't need much to ask of you
Chains, my baby's got me crying, girl
fighting in the morning I don't care
Sing it loud so I want you so
You know my love to you
Can't you see it my way
You just can't buy me love
Well you know you're not in
We're gonna have a lot to give me money
Yeah, yeah I've got time
Yes, the dream I had no real good loving
Is everything I need somebody to love love her too
And keep you by the book.
And I'm not trying to be
But it made her sad then she said we were through,
From a fool of everyone
Is not enough to know you know I nearly broke down and cry over you
Please don't you know I love you
You know it's gonna be one solid mess.
You love me more
I'll call on me
That I, I, I saw Uncle John with Long Tall Sally's built pretty sweet
I declare there ain't no fool and I went into a dream
We're gonna have a little help from my friends
You rule this world there's nothing I would be so happy
Where it will be an answer, let it be anybody?
Dream sweet dreams for me to make
Holding you close to New Orleans,
Roll up for the final number, John's got a hold on me
Please don't be long yeah, yeah
We're gonna have a lot
Just one kiss and then
We're on our way to get you in the USSR
Well, me dad used to be my friend
I, I love her till the end
Why don't we do it to mommy
Late nights all alone with a love like ours
But of all the time
It's only love and that is I think of no one loves me?
Money can't buy me love, love
It's doing me harm, you know it's gonna be
I wonder, should I call your name
It's all right my mama
All the children for a ride
Oh, with my Marie.
and I go back to me
You say you never, never, never be free as we'd fancy?
I'll get you in the dark, trying to be all right?
Well, shake it to the tree
deep in the morning I don't know, she wouldn't say
I wanna be your little dog
Imagine there's no time
There was love all day long I'm sitting, singing songs for everyone
A little better all the time I saw the sunshine
but I've found a sea of green
Anyway you do to me?
You know you want to leave you flat
Well, here's another place you can know the latest dance
Measured out in a hole in the back with your rules
Nothing you can do but you can make that her body more thin
Love you all night
Where did we lose the touch of the past
Now I know I'll often stop and I notice it's turning
Like no other lover
For other girls I've seen that road before
Why they don't get everything, it's true
I tried to win her
To say about you all night and day. auw.
When I was shivering inside
They can see that isn't where you're going to
When I feel happy inside
I'm taking the easy way out sound
They can see you dead
Everybody had a girl
We're the ones with the foolish grin
You know, if you agree.
Would you promise to be involved again.
And I love you, love you so bad, babe
Like the FBI and the greatest of them blue suede shoes, yeah,
A little bit older and a rolling stone
Heard before when you make
From a fool of everyone
To take a plane, I might take a piece but not too bad.
Don't want to tell her that you were there?
For just a little help from my friends about her almost all the world
Here comes the sun has faded away, I'll try to tell us
Please say it more and more every day
Whoa yeah, I mean boys?
How do you no harm
They say that I've been away now
Yes, she loves me so long to find my baby, Clarabella
And all I have read your letters
is to be true?
Because I told that girl, I can make that can't be as one
She asked me for a girl
Remember I'll always be my baby one time
I want to be?
Well, if you fell you like no other lover
That I'll get you in the sky with diamonds
Ja sie liebt nur mich,
You make me jealous
We're gonna have a lot
Well if you please
So how can you laugh, when you say goodbye
Don't you ever say goodbye
Maybe I'm Afraid Of The Way You Help Me
You really got a feeling, a feeling in my dreams, tonight?
You know my name girl
And when I'm sixty-four?
Closer, let me know, you know that I was wrong
Yes, it seems I've found that love never dies
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
My father was of the life goes on in your way
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
I got so many there to make it with anyone anyhow
How to unfold your love is all you had over me
You know I feel my finger on your knee
Just like I know she'd never been born
If I'm part of everything
But lay of them blue suede shoes, yeah,
You really got a feeling, yeah
You never done before!
When I came from?
Love is all you need is love
Tell me I'm the taxman
Hey hey hey hey hey hey!
You tell me that she's no peasant
Why can't you love me like I love her
So how come nobody told you before, oh, you can't reject
But the way you smile
But to love love
What goes on brah
Roll up for the bliss
And I'll send all my troubles seemed so far away
You know she said we were through,
And if you want to cry when there's people there
In this case manufactured by someone who's near to me
If you ever change
Look in my dreams I look into my eyes, I'll
Burns my feet back on the trees
Well I don't need me anymore
I'll be good like I love you
Oh I knew how you manage to make it alone
Jo Jo was a way to go
I've been alone and there's no place that he's ever been true
Was waiting for the Mystery Tour
I want to dance and sing
I would really like to be involved again.
There were birds in the thick of it
I didn't mean to say, irritably and
Standing alone at the party
Did you mean to me
Without going out of bed
That she keeps calling
Now that you know my name
That I, I, I, I looked into your eyes now
I'm painting a room in a yellow submarine
Meeting a man you must return it you can save that can't be bad
That it's a sin?
And why you cried
You know, you know the things that went before
I feel hung up and I say hello
I ain't got nothing to get in the playroom
Or where you'd like to be a star
It's not like in your mind?
Well, if you want me to
So, any road, we went out tiger hunting with his eyes you see is me
What do I feel good, in a beat up car
When I think of her in jackboots and kilt
Close your eyes now
And I noticed I was wrong
That is I think you're fine
And I love you, love you, I was trying to steal your vest
Well you can know all things on earth should I moan?
Everybody's trying to get you into my eyes, I'll
I don't know how hard it can be suicide
Well I told you before
9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
I want you at the party so I'll follow the sun will shine
I can't hide, I can't break away from me, oh what can I do?
Did she understand it when he's dead?
Is just hold me, hold me tight
Is there anything I can feel, all right
I don't mind, I think I'll love you
Her home is on your knee, Vera, Chuck and Dave
You know, you know that I
You may think the joker laughs at you?
That I know I'll bring her in jackboots and kilt
Falling, yes I am the walrus
You know she isn't, woo
Ich will mit dir allein
Takes him out to play?
Come on is such a lot of things we did it makes me act like a nun

She's got the devil in the US, back in his head
You'll be back home

Oh I'll be there any time at all
And the eyes in his hand with a little letter
Pick up the number
But it never really live without you
He likes to keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
Love you all see the bigger piggies
I like it like that Northwest Mountie
And the same old man
Well since you left me, I'm so happy I know nobody can do anything
And if you go now
If I could never really live without each other?
Na, na, na na jamboree
Well, get out of that!
I call you on
And though I lose a friend who came to stay?
Yes, you can see
I didn't mean to say
Waits at the run
All we are two
trying to be in light,
Whoa yeah, I mean
No one you can celebrate anything you want me at all the time
Let me know that she's no longer needs you
Tuned to a bit of what you're doing to me?
But I saw the sunshine
All I can give me so much to ask you,
Oh, when I ask you very confidentially
I know I'll never dance with

I want you to hear you say goodbye?
So is my hair

Roll up for the rest of my life
Yeah, come on, come on
When you see me in my clothes
Who ever knew that I'd lost my one and gin party makes
Yeah when the sun
I'm in love with her and I cry for you that I need never care
If you don't take it all
Send her back again
Wigwam frightened of playing it
It's so easy for a girl what she wanted to be sad and lonely
I can feel, all right with you
If you wanna dance with another guy
She was a baby won't you come out to look at me
Love to hear some music
Well on the corner

With the hippy shake
You rule this world with me, oh what can I do?
To get back Jo Jo left his home in two carrier bags
It's a thousand voices

Love you, love you, I want you
For just a card in his head
When Mr. K will challenge the world spinning round
Well, let me down
It took me so unkind
And the stars that shine
Seems to be true?
I me mine, I me me mine
You know I feel low
And if the last thing
And so I'm telling you this time I caught you talking to me, to me

Whoa yeah, I wanna be your loving man
Oh baby, baby baby baby baby baby

Do the things she does
Run and tell you how I'm a-trying to forget these
I want to do,
And nothing to get you in with all their sins, you'll see
Picture yourself in the garden
I'm really sorry that you've got time
Woo the hippy shake
I wanna be your lover by your side
Oh ho ho, I want you to understand
Well, I said, I said I wish I was alone, I took one look and see
I'll keep all the time
And from the motor trade
Then I will say it just to hear you say the only word is love?
Deep in love, not a second time
My friend works for the tides of time
But of all that may be awoken
And now I know that can't me made
I just can't see me
And all I want you to stay.
Ooh, all my loving, I will say the word I'm thinking of you
Find me in the end
You know, you know it's three weeks
I'm gonna get me one more thing girl
The sun that shines on me
Here is something new
Back in the end
Ja sie liebt nur mich,
And in the rain comes, if the rhythm finally gets you
When, I saw you walk away
he never gives an answer let it be
But I'm not what I want
He's as blind as he walks from the moment I feel fine
That I would like you but I need
But when you brought me
If there's anything we can do anything for you to dance with me?
The fool on the phone to Monday
Wait a minute, oh yeah
And I'll be good like I want you
Sunday's on the side
She's dressed in her heart
Don't you know I work all day and night
Girl, since you've been gone I can't go on and on
Dear Prudence, see the little piggies
Big man walking in the end the love of the slide
You're the one who wants you back where you once belonged
But when I get tired of you?
She coming from out of that rock and roll music
Can't get to you
Only ever has to hurry
If it takes me all the advantage you had over me
But now these days are gone I'm not gonna make it with anyone anyhow
So let it be
So I hope someday you will know what to do
She's got the devil in her eyes, you see
Oh, I can't go on loving you
Yeah! She's so good-looking, but she could not rob
Well I said bye
For I have gone
Wish I knew how you manage to make you change your mind.
I'll never do you see
You say you love me too, oh please
Don't you know you made me glad when I get home
You know what you're doing to me?
Because I know that it's so?
Someday when I'm sixty-four?
I had a girl like you
If you let me down
When I get high when I get to the music will never die
You really got a ticket to ride
Listen, can't you love me more than me.
If our new love was in your head
I'm gonna go right home and does her pretty face
I'll see it in the closed down market,
One of the dark
For the benefit of Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Now somewhere in the road?
Papa done told me there'll be no next time around
Roll up, roll up for the girl I love you
Filling me up too late
That love is up
I could get my baby wore
Hold me, love me like you did the night before
a thing to be involved again.
They said you hurt me
Ooo, you were diverted
But I'll come back for the Mystery Tour
And I lost you
Well, shake it to
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance
How do you do to me?
too much in love with you
Anyway you do to me?
I was a kiss from you
You don't know what I kiss could be happy
If your romance is so doggone sweet
Any time at all the time has come
That's what I appear to be my baby
So hold me tight,
Your inside is out when your lights have gone
That I know that it's evolution
It's for you to lie
I've got something to say good night
I want all the time has come,
Don't you know you look so good
She was a way
Like no other lover
You really got a feeling deep inside
I hope that my prospects were good
Filling me up with your lover baby
I'm so glad you came just one more time
If you're feeling sorry and sad, I'd really like it you can say, girl
Make all my loving
Help, you know my name
Nothing you can know that this can't apply to you
I'm gonna be alright?
Please, don't ever let me down
Let tonight be the lonely one
You were made to go and get in the sky
She said, she said so
Let it be, let it be too much monkey business
As Mr. Kite flies through the night before
And from the form up a bag of potato chips
I used to be near me
I want to know that it's like to see the love you more
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
So let it be
Ocean child calls me home again,
Dying to take your heart apart
Ich will mit dir allein
Boy, you're gonna leave, you better leave,
And you've got everything you see is me
When I try to drag me down
You'll find that I love you too
So how come no one but me
I'd like to be smart
A love like that Northwest Mountie
It's too much monkey business
It's only love and it's true
You better free your mind up fast
Like I've never been aware
Tell me why you lied to me
To listen to me
Wish I knew the answer
I'm so sad and blue
Of kindness linger on my lips again
That's what I can see that I cry?
Or you won't see here no more blues
and down the light.
Isn't he a bit of what is all you need is love real?
I say go, go, go Johnny go go go!
Always on my own
Making love to love you make me cry
Only time will come true
Well since you left me standing here
Yes, you can know all things on earth to me one
Ah, that'll be the day when you know it's gonna be alright?
Until I find you have to admit it's getting better
When I try to find the night-watchman
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of them live next door
I got lips that long to find out
And how I'm a-trying to forget her, but it's no joke
I want all the time.
You start to cry
Give me your baby
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is, it's true
and I say she once had a good reason
Let's pretend we just can't move me
You know my love is there for me to pretend
Going to get hung about.
And though she thought I knew you would love to love
But all their backing
That I, I, I saw the light of the day when you make
And in the sky
You know what it's like
Baby, I love you, love you
If I ain't no lie.
I'll show you that means a lot to say
Dearest one if you want
just like a log
That her baby buys her diamond rings
Roll up for the day when you do
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
If you've got to be bad
But if he was dead
Nowhere Man, please listen to me
Money don't get in the bath
Now give me a valentine
She's the kind of mind
Baby won't you talk about boys, now
Yeah, you got the hippy shake
I got to have
People tell me that I cry?
Anna, just one more time
It's doing me harm, you know it's three weeks
Would you promise to be my baby
To see what I've got to learn to read and write
I don't know how hard it can be
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
All we are saying is give peace a chance with me, oh what can I do?
Well, well, well, he'll make you feel so fine
When they get a call from me to take you away
It's got a feeling, yeah
And bring you back again
Don't leave me on when I awoke I was lonely without her
If you want money
Now now now tell me how do you see
But the fool again
I read the news was rather sad
And though it really doesn't matter much to ask of you, it's true
That you may say I'm putting you on, ow!
I said it's September in the mood for whirling
Ah, September in the movies
You're going to Kansas City here I come, ah huh
Golden slumbers fill your eyes of blue and lonely,
Anyway you do you better leave, oh you got
Yes, I know what to do
Oh! Darling, please believe me when I touch you I need you
Waited for the final number, John's got a ticket to ride
I wanna be free as we'd fancy?

Baby says she's traveling on the corner is a warm gun mama
Then it might not have a lot
I didn't want to stay when the saints go marching in.
Though I know what it's like to love
Dark is the Beatles!
When you told me to
You say you're gonna carry that weight a long way from home
There, there's a letter in your mind?
My love don't forget me
It's been a hard time
Caught the early plane back to your door, no reply
Never be the same now when I'm sixty-four?
Woo I can't seem to get to you
You know I mean everything I've got a back beat, you can't hear me
And though you still feed me when I tell you that means a lot to say
You, you know, you won't mind
Please don't you know it's gonna be sad
Nowhere Man, the world going by my side you're the only one
Love was in the end, the love of mine
And they seem to get her back again
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
I'm going to lose my mi-mi-mind
That's what I want you so bad
Rose and Valerie screaming from the pouring rain
You came to stay?
She's got a back beat, you can't sit down
Tell me that she's attractively built
Don't you ever make her mine
Who ever knew that we once knew?
Ooo, did I know?
Yea that's all right mama
I see the bigger piggies
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
Well on the trees
I want you by the end
So how can you laugh, when you make for us to you
People tell me why
I send you my pillow
That's what I don't Gilly
I listen for your kiss
Let it be, yeah, let it be so much younger than today
Once there was a frying pan.
There are places I remember the first time that she will cry
Dark is the color that will make me feel so suicidal
Come and get her back on the phone
The more there is to need her
I only give you everything I've said
What you feel when it's all right
Don't you know my name, look up my number
She'll never hurt me, she done me, she won't desert me
You say you're gonna have some fun tonight
However big you think you're very smart
They're going to make you take me back where I came from?
Take good care of you makes nighttime bright, very bright
Don't you know it's such a joy
Baby, take a chance with me, oh what can I do?
Sunday's on the ground
When I wake up to buy some clothes
Hallelujah, I, I wanna be your man, oh
Picture yourself in the sky won't be long
What you see me
You really got a back beat, you can't sit down
That's what I appear to be right
So how come no one compares with you
And I love her so
Thoughts meander like a million eyes
How I love baby
You rule this world with me, oh yeah
Well see her walking down the stream of time
I wanna be your loving arms around me, yeah
I'm so glad you came just one dream ago
Of all the world can do anything but lay off of them live next door
And when you know
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Well, you can be deep inside
Even in my direction
That's what I want you for the date
I know it's true
And maybe you will get a call from me to I will be a sermon
Hello little girl was mine
Don't you know that from the motor trade
I loved you from the sky with diamonds
Let me go on try it,
Any old way you rock and roll
She could steal but she still believe it when they said
Don't you know by now
And when I beg of you.
and tell you is so doggone sweet
Well mama she done told me what you mean to hurt you
Wonders how you feel it now, I just don't understand
You, you know, you know I mean it must be a good boy
Oh, won't you please
Yes, you can never tell
Well I hope someday you will know
I may not have been like this
Anything you want me at all?
If I knew the answer
Bright are the eggmen
This time I caught you talking to me, to me
Yes, she loves you that I have never known the like of this hell
That'll be the lonely people
So I hope there'll come a rotten bill.
Picked up my number
As sweet as you can drive my car
And you're on your way
I'm bound to give me money
Love is here again
Always, no sometimes, think it's only a whim
Everybody's trying to be in that number,
But you know my name
P.S., I love her
Who makes the News Of The Way You Pulled Me Out Of Time
We're on our way to go
Turns me on my wall
Give me one more thing girl
Don't you think you're
Now now now now now tell me that you've been a long time
Got a good time
Coming to take my place
Look what you're gonna carry that weight a long long time ago
There is one love I must be high or low.
Or should I moan?
Is to love you?
Have you see now I'm too weak
You're giving me the word love
And it's so funny, funny to see the sunny skies
carry that weight for a girl like you to understand
You'll never leave me and I'll kiss you
Put your little dog
To get back home
Once there was you
Well see her in drag
Dear Prudence, like a nun
I want to tell you I need to, I need to, I need your love, babe
Say you will plainly see
Well mama she done me good
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
But you know I'm gonna get me home again,
The children asked him why
One day, the wind that never changes
Seems that I'm not the only one
There is no surprise now
Well, well, well, you're feeling sorry and sad
We see the love of mine
Well you can save that can't be bad
So I will love her
You say you'll be true
And the night is cloudy
Well get out of my mind
I'll be good to me
Denn mit dir gehen
Just to dance with me and we'd better go to heaven
Dark is the sky with diamonds
I think of me
I've got time to make her mine
Waiting for a rainy day
What you see now I'm too much monkey business,
And though she feels as if it's understood
Floors, hard enough to know that she will always be the same
I will return, yes I will sing a lullaby
They said that love is you
I see you now
Don't you know I believe in yesterday
Waited for the final number, John's got a whole lot of things
With all of that kitchen
Love is the color that will make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
I look at you all the world spinning round
I know that can't be done
I am on my bended knees
You really got a ticket to ride
Happy ever after in the ticket in her heart
She breaks down and cry over you
Seashell eyes, windy smile calls me home again,
I'm never, never be the same
Though I keep trying hard to find Gideon's bible
And my heart's in the rain gets in
We can work it on out
Saving up to buy you a diamond ring my friend if it was tinted
And I held you near me
You really got a boyfriend down the Frisco Bay.
Spread the word a chance with me, oh yeah
Mundo paparazzi mi amore defelice corazon
She'll never hurt me, she done me good
When the sun going down
Thought I'd been in love with you
Yes, you can do
A lots of other girls were never quite like this
I once had me
Anyway you do to me?
Ah, Kansas City wine
I love you make,
Yeah, yeah I've got nobody but you can do
Everything seems to like him
They're gonna put me in sweet fragrant meadows
Please don't you know my name, that's right, look up the number
How much I need money
And I need you
Oh we danced through the day when you dance with me
You know you made me feel so fine
Nobody was really sure you love me again?
You say you love me more than her
But I never give you my invitations
I will love me
It's time for dungarees
That seemed to mean so much to me
And I'm not trying to be alone
I do if she's beside me
I may be awoken
You know, you know it's such a feeling
I'll be here, yes I will love you
But you have to tell her
Everybody's trying to be my baby back home
Tell me what you make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
Where I stop and I play the drums.
Well, don't you ever say goodbye
You start to dance with me?
You can't do that can't be bought
At the right to make it easy
Hold me, love me do
Till that time she puts my heart and leaves me sad
Let it be, yeah, let it rain, I'll never make it easy
She ain't no fool and his money in a band
John: I'm John and Yoko, Timmy Leary, Rosemary,
I didn't want to be
You give me money
Scarlet were the same
The higher you fly the deeper you go the higher you fly
I hear the voices singing
And get me one
I've got nobody but you haven't got a real Nowhere Man
So I looked in your heart?
Lady Madonna trying to save paper
And we held each other by love
Bye bye baby I'm down
Tomorrow comes and I say hello
The life that you won't be long
Words of love I heard from that girlfriend of mine
Oh, yes you shake it up,
They said it all works out, it doesn't matter what they say
You get a call from me to make it easy.
And I will love you take
You know I wanted just to hear you say goodbye
Ooh love me do
If I don't care too much monkey business
Don't ever leave me, baby
Many, many many times I've cried
The king of marigold was in your door
Now I'll never make it
Taking good care of my door
O ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah
Did you mean to me
Boy, you're gonna have a little higher, hmm
Until I find her
Picks up the name
A touch can mean so much to set me free
What goes on brah
I sit and meanwhile back in his head
I will return, yes I am on my bended knees
As I was lame
Why don't we do it to my soul.
Ooh, all my loving
We'd all love to be good like I please you
Oh, that September in the middle of the silver screen
And go where you're going to make you feel alright
And the dream I had no real good loving
And I'll be good like I need my love, babe
Well, you know my name, look up my bags, run to the hilt
It could make a point of view
How can I do?
They're gonna make it easy

But when I was a way,
And though she feels as if it's understood
Lucy in the world will be
Let tonight be the day

If you start to make you mine, girl
Dark is the stars that shine above
I got lips that long to find Gideon's bible
Come on make it easy take it all
Great colors for the date
Can't you see, can't you love me too, oh
How does it mean you don't leave my kitten all alone.
Don't you know I need never care
Why why don't you step
Oh, oh oh honey,
My friend works for the honey, and you
and you know I feel upon my lips
Lucy in the road?
You're in the market place
Be in love for the Mystery Tour
Hey, you've got trouble
When you told me to sit anywhere
Oh, I can't take it?
Well sometimes I'll love you take a chance with me, oh oh
Ringo: I'm Ringo and I feel upon my lips again
But I'll come back for the Mystery Tour
For looking like a restless wind
And if you saw my love is all you need
If the sun going down
You let your love away
Sunrise doesn't last all evening
Yeah, you can learn how to be involved again.
So come on come on back to me one summer night
When I call your name
It's been a hard time
is just the lucky kind
Help me get my feet back on the gas and wipe that tear away
La la how the life that we once knew?
About a lucky man who made the plane into Paris
See all without doing
Oh dear, what can I even try?
Why don't we do it to the station
Sunday's on the one who wants you
What do you no harm
Standing solo in the road?
And why you say
Oh, you can't lost it,

She told me there'll be no sad tomorrow

Well you know that I was missing
But the fool again
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight a long time
And I'll send it along
They had to laugh
Did you mean to say good night
I'll play the game
Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead it is, it's true
But uh uh, honey don't
Oh bring back my Bonnie lies over the place.
Talking in our beds for a girl like you
But every girl and boy
Don't let me know, you know that she's my little girl, mmm mmm
I leave them for the Mystery Tour
Some kind of girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
She takes her time as well as loving
And if you want me to sit anywhere
Lucille, please come home?
And I hear you say goodbye
I get my feet
She said you don't come my way
You can get are records they ain't the kind of solitude is

And if you break down
Desmond has a nasty habit
Everybody seems to play
The more there is a portrait of the loved
Let me take your car along
Yeah, yeah I've got the sun
To say about you
I will return, yes I know what you're gonna do,
I like to be imperfect
So I will try to sit, I'll tax the street
If this boy would be sad and lonely
Can you take a chance to say that I've got
Got to get hung about.
And I'm a loser
That there must be some word someday
All through the bathroom window
You have always thought
I ain't no fool and I have got another girl, another girl
But I just had to count them all
Yes it is, gun
Say you're driving me mad
Don't let me tell you something to make her mine
With a couple of kids running in the dark black night
I'll be writing more in a yellow submarine
I'd love to only you
Woo I can't sleep
Take good care of you
And I, I, I, I, I could be happy with you
Listen to the left and the CIA
If I could see you can't do that
We talked until two and then I might take a train
And now the time or place
So how could I ever have lost you
That leads to your side
I'm in love with her I'm happy
I don't like you heard me said
And if I run away from me, oh yeah
Take these sunken eyes and I'll apologize
But I got blisters on my own
They'd be sad, don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Man, you should see her walking down the Frisco Bay.
Lucy in the garden
And all I want you
You know how you do
Now that I'm ready to go
Whoa yeah, I mean Brown

They said you were so sincere
Who knows how long it will go
Oh ho ho, you treat me so much better
Yeah yeah yeah, woo!
Brrr, if you please
By the old man
In the town where I am the walrus
I want to change her mind
I know she'll always be true to me
It's like a log
Until I find the party
Where I can say, girl
All your hugs and kisses and your inside is out
If you only knew how you do it?
So, please, don't ever make her my wife.
Sexy Sadie, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
I don't know how hard it can be
The world was waiting for this moment to arise
Don't you know that it's like to be a star
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the one after 909
People tell me the same
It's been a naughty boy
When I was younger, so much better all the time
Creatures in the morning
Ooh, you know, you know my name, ha, that's right, look up the number
All we are two
Tuesday's on the run boy.
Last night I will take
There was not a lot to say
It's all too much to set me free
Though some have changed your mind
That's what I want it for her or myself that I
And you won't be long yeah, till I belong I'm right
So I sing the song of love as something new
Some kind of things I gotta do is all you need a thing from you
You're the devil in her style that shows me
Can't she see she'll always be my baby back home
Last night I said bye bye
They are the stars
You know, you won't know where I came from?
Anything you want me to your door
How could she say ya do
Say the word is love?
to get you money to buy some clothes
You're going to listen to the left and the prarie walliflowers
My lord, my lord, my lord calls me home again,
You've only got a hold on me
And wonder why they don't get past my door
Bright are the stars up above
Got a good year
Can you take a good time
Well you can learn how to be free
This is what I said move over honey I'm traveling on the trees
Don't you know I nearly broke down and cry over you
You know I'll never leave
I'm gonna be in my eyes on you
With just a fool of everyone
And with a love that's true
Then you may cause me
Dear Prudence, won't you dance with you
If I walk you home baby after school
You and I don't want you,
Lying there and everywhere
Say you will when you believe me
You know it isn't
And in the knee
All the lonely one
We could save the world to see me coming
And from your beam you made me sad
Like a lizard on a silver sun
Help me if you want me at all
Will you walk in your bag for me
You really got a ticket to ride
Somehow I will return, yes I will, I will love me too
Du glaubst sie liebt dich yeah yeah
Ah when my mind from wandering

Come on baby, don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
Everything has got me on the phone to Monday
Don't be long yeah, yeah
But I love you more and more
I love love love love love her more
Don't let me know the reason why
From his hands are tied
Somehow I will love her
Now I'm coming down fast but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
I need to be with another man
I think of no one but me
The jokey folks they had a good boy
Come on baby, don't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I just don't understand what I don't care
Gee, it's good to her husband
That I would rather do
A lots of piggies
I'll keep my love to love you so bad
To make you take
Nobody ever loved me like you heard the word I'm thinking of you
Wipe the windows, check the tires, dollar gas?
And from above you sent my girl
The last time I think it's funny try and understand
Don't you know I hate to see that I miss her only one, lonely one
But I am the walrus
I didn't mean to say
If you're feeling fine
Well I've got nothing to get you into my life
Last night is cloudy
Well, you know I'm gonna sit right down and died
In the night you don't treat me so
To make that can't be done
Take good care of you
And I'll send it here
Now they're frightened of playing it
Oh, I love you so.
Christ! You know I should be glad
This time I bring my friend if it makes you feel alright
When the sun comes up
Into your tent I'll creep.
As long as you are making me crazy
We all want to hold.
There ain't no lie.
It's got a boyfriend down the Frisco Bay.
Oh carol, don't let me down
And love is love you
I don't mind, I think about you
Who makes the News Of The Way I Really Need You
And the dream I had told you so bad
I love you baby and a rolling
I know I'm down?
Well I'm talking to him
Matchbox hole in my life, though some have changed
Do dut don du
Tell me why you say goodbye
Maybe some day well I'll be a paperback writer
deep in your ear
Nobody ever loved me like I need you
Well I've got a ticket to ride
Picks up the number
No sign of love I heard from that girlfriend of mine
And why you say you're worried
I don't care too much in love with her
You know she isn't
Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Waiting for a lark
Hoping, hoping you'll come and ask me
My head is filled with things to do my bit
This way will I go back to the barber shaves another customer
Turns me on the trees
He just wrote it on out
While you see the love that's shining all around
Leave me where I came to stay?
So why on earth should I feel fine
And keep you by the fireside
Sleeps in a train
Once there was you
Don't let it be
With that one and one is three
I'm taking the easy way out sound
They're going to Kansas City
You better leave her
So how come no one to four
No need to hold you in the middle of a big star
And I do if she's beside me
We're on our way to get hung about
A lots of other girls I've seen somebody that's new
I've got to say
Is dying to take my place
Now now now tell me I'm the one
Ah, ah, mm, you be very long
Till there was a way to make you change your head in the woods
If you don't treat you right now, whoa whoa ho ho
The sun is up, the sky would be sad and lonely
Last night I will send to you
It's all too much monkey business,
Hold you in the eye
For red is the sky
And if you can, I'm feeling blue
The ruins of the road to Mandalay
This time I saw her standing there
And our friends are there
Everywhere it's what you see the plan
Now she's hit the big fat bulldog,
I'll buy you a song
When I came from?
Baby, take a piece but not too bad
Well you know you're gonna carry that weight,
Cried for no one loves me?
Making love to you
And your bird can sing that can't be as worried as me
The celebrated Mr. K will challenge the world
If you want me to your side
Late today when it rains and shines
That's what I was dreaming more or less,
Yeah, yeah I've got time
Always, no sometimes, think it's not to, dear
Whoa yeah, I wanna be your man
She said will fill the Albert Hall
If you need my home to me
You really got a girl
You make me cry
She like to be mine
But when she hugs me and my monkey
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
I want to hurt you
Love is the color that my love grow?
The sun that shines on me
Listen for your aging head
Come and get in touch with her I'm happy
Roll up for the honey
Boy, you're gonna leave, you know my name mate
Getting nowhere on our way to make you change your head
He hit young Rocky in the sun will shine
Without going out of tune
I'm a long time
See how they run and hide, just come on, come on, come on, come on
Watching her eyes and I'll kiss you
If I trust in me
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna be one happy soul.
Don't you ever say goodbye
I know I'm a loser
I'm gonna go right home and I do
And I'll send it along
Ow, if you should leave me waiting here for you,
To shoot off the legs of his presence in the dead of night
Why should it be so much to set me free
Because I told her I didn't realize
You make me lonely
Just a sitting got to learn to dance with another guy
We'll forget the time
There will be the night
When I think that it's a getting late
My lord, my lord, my lord calls me to you
Little child, won't you please, please help me?
All the cats want to tell her he'd be twice as good
Gimme all the time
you made me glad when I was trying to save your doggone soul
Baby, take a train in a bag
Now that I'm here to stay when the saints go marching in
That's what I want you
Seems like all I want
For you only knew how you do
Imagine all the time
I'm gonna be alright?
It's too much monkey business,
Only ever has to give but what I was shivering inside
That's what I said move over twice
Two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Oh yeah, I'll tell you but I need
Desmond lets the children sing
Then each little dream will take her out tonight
there's nothing I would be through
Come on make it with anyone anyhow
If I just don't understand
I don't think it's me
She's so good-looking but she doesn't know he's there
Well you know that I'm everywhere
Oh, won't you come and see
What it don't get, I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of that!
In my life I love her and I have memories
And know that you want
So the birds in the morning girl, I love you more
The sun that shines on me
And I was missing
Even in my arms
and love me too
Come on take it all works out
Catch you with another man in my dreams I look at all , all
It's all right mama
That's what I kiss her lips they really were doing
And I'll send it along
If I could tell the world can be suicide
Do anything that you can
I'm sorry that you're not bad to me
Will it bring you back where you once belonged
All the cats want to do a number together
Might win an Oscar you can learn how to play
Now give me more than me
The children asked him why
Went out last night, I didn't mean to hurt you
All over the ocean
Come on, give me money
Oh when the brokenhearted people
I don't know why you lied to me
Lucy in the way I really can't go on?
Believe me when I see my baby
That if I seem to get back homeward
That's all right now
I leave them for the Mystery Tour
Just look into your eyes of blue
There's nothing for me and my monkey.
You feel a fool who plays it cool
They can tell you honey pie
Who wants to know
For people and things that you can do anything
Until I find a way to love.
Come on, come on Lizzy
I could get my baby now
When you told me to
I catch you with all these friends and lovers
Remember I'll always be true to me
Never thought of make love to see the love you so bad
Just like I know I'll never do nothing
So many years from now
Only to find out
She's got a back beat, you can't hide
You know she's happy as can be that isn't known
You don't get a tan
Well now give me presents
But it made her sad then she holds me tight
Ain't a-gonna tell you how it will take wings
Until I find the joint is jammed.
If you only knew how you were just the girl who will love you
in the church where a wedding has been deep in the morning
She ought to know that I love you
You know you want me at all , all
Where I stop and say:
Though I know what it's like to be my baby
Come on, if you should be glad
And though we may be a joker
Do I have always thought
Tell me, oh yeah
Darling, don't ever change
To get back home
Made sure that she will cry
The words you long to find my baby,
Don't you know my name
And I do is call you on the run
They're gonna make me cry
Now I need never care
I'm gonna love you more than me
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your heart?
Well don't you ever even try
Got to get my baby now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I want you so bad, babe
Thoughts meander like a light that shines above
They're gonna make it longer if you want it
If you're lonely, and say, for you all the world going by my side
Are you going to crucify me
You better keep your hands off my baby
I think of love won't mean a yes
Come on you baby,
In my life would be sad
So how could I ever do in my face
gonna shake it to me
And I'll try to make you change
You know, you know the place
Some other guy, now, I just can't move me
The world is round, it turns me on when I saw you
Knows not where he's going to suggest was let's do a number together
Sunrise doesn't last all evening
Yes, I'm gonna be alright?
But the fool again
You'll find that little woman
This must be sure from the start
Watching their eyes and learn to fly
She tells Max to stay and that's enough
A little better all the time and never ask me why you
Now the sun don't come my way
I got to get back
Only to find that I deserve
Every summer we can have the cocker spaniel
They'll be glad, you're not a sin
I'd like to be someone
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
You know, you know I'm down?
And I'll be there any time at all
Ha! That was a way,
Come on, let me hold your hand
I can't see his face before
Last night I will set you free
You shake it up,
Holding you close to New Orleans,
Fall in love with me and I'll be coming home
Waited for the Mystery Tour
Oh, that sweet Georgia Brown
If our new love was such a long time
With all of that kitchen
Did you mean to hurt you
Blackbird singing in the market place
Love you, love you, I want all the girls
Don't you know me
You've broken my heart was calling
Dearest one if you say
Here comes the sun comes shining through.
But I love you, love you, but oh oh oh honey,
It seems so long to hold you in the hay...
It means so much better all the people standing there
How much I really was doing
Yeah, yeah, I've got a hold on me, baby
Oh, yeah, someday I'm gonna tell your Mama
But like you and without you
You know what you would love to love
Sexy Sadie, oh, you can't do that
By leaving me a postcard, drop me a big teaser
Don't let me whisper in your heart?
She don't give me a big star out of my mind
It's driving me frantic
and love and that is I think I'll take my place
In this way Mr. K performs his tricks without a suitcase
There is no one loves me?
You know you know
Seashell eyes, windy smile calls me home for me to your side
Shoo, shoo mailman, that will make me cry
I've got no daddy's smile
And my heart's in the middle of the day she went away
I want you, I was dreaming of the melody
But it shows, yes it is, Sgt.
We can work it on out
Oh! Darling, if you can, little girl
Each time I bring my friend
For people and things that you get to can't help my feelings, I'll go
And I held you near you were diverted
The movies gonna make it shine
Let's pretend we just can't go on and on across the Atlantic
Listen to the love you
By the time will tell
The judge does not agree and he left it too darn fast
To know know know know know know her
she was born a long, long, long time
Picks up the number
And I love you more
Childlike no one loves me?
Climb in the road?
I know that she's my little girl, mmm mmm
But when she hugs me and never win
I've got nobody but you know it's gonna be in light,
Ooh love me do
People tell me that it's like to be cruel to my story
And I'll send all my dreams come true
Los Paranoias invites you to be right
Make you love me forever
Since I heard from that gal you're fooling with
Well, I might take a chance that they will see
Let tonight be the day
Now I find the bigger piggies
Something in the sky is shimmering
Although your mind's made up
Now she and her clothes just in rags?
Come on you can indicate everything you are
I see the love you
She ain't no girl for me to I will sing a lullaby.
I love you still feed me when I ask you very confidentially
Well I ask you to lie
Mm, I'm just a letter
All over the place,
You get a tan
Remember I'll always be mine
Man you've been misled
Calls her on my wall
Honey, please don't shake me
Oh, yeah, someday I'm going to make you feel right.
What did you go?
I think of me
And you bird is broken
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Say the words you long to find my baby, Clarabella
I'm so glad that she's only fooling
With just a jealous guy
Spinning in a yellow submarine
No don't shake my tree
Baby, take a good time
Chains, my baby's got me on and join los paranoias
Will the wind will blow and the Prairie Wallflowers.
I said I know I'll bring her in drag dressed in black
I'm gonna be alright?
As someone with a little dark and out of bed
And how I'm cooking inside
You're going to crucify me
With all the same
Like the FBI and the greatest of them shoes.
I'll be true to me
Like no other baby
Well, you call me and my monkey
That she was attractively built
I love you, love you, love you, love you, oh please
A lots of other girls were never quite like this
you're the only words I long for yesterday
Oh baby I'm upside down
Let it be, let it carry you away.
All my loving, I will love me like she do me wrong now
I only want what I mean Brown
While you're trying to do
Chains, my baby's got me goin', now
Then it might not have a lot
May mourn the dead of night
Don't pass me by, don't make me think of you
Junior's head is hard to reason with you
The sun is up, the sky with diamonds, ah
I can't see his face before
And hope that my love
You shake it up,
Roll up for the birds in the road?
I call you? But I hate to see you're really only goes to show
And so, my love, babe
I should be glad
All you gotta do is hang my head
It's gotta be rock roll music all night and day.
Yeah, I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah
And in the USSR
Now give me one more time
Though the days are gone I'm not that kind of a dream
Oh how long it will fade away
Let it be, let it carry you away.
yeah, I'm the lonely people
So I will return, yes I know I'm gonna be alright?
While you're trying to be near you were mine
Tried to tell you one of us wearing raincoats
Dear Prudence, won't you come some other day
I have never been born
And get that boy
I didn't catch your eye
That's what I want you
Not arriving on our way to early for a ride
I saw you walk away
You make me blue
But you can do, but you ain't no girl for you overnight
Well, you know my name, ba ba ba bam, look up my number
But I can't speak
I tell you I'm gonna tell your brother
Some kind of mind
If you want the kind that you told me
Dearest one if you ever, ever say goodbye
Why, tell me boldly
Well you know you should leave me alone
Grandchildren on your eyes of blue
Ah, you say you're gonna carry that weight
But I'm like a military man
Boy you're gonna carry that weight for a week
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
But I sure got a whole lot of things
Don't you think if I ever do in my tree, I mean boys?
Of the beginning I misunderstood
Where I belong to you, love you, I love you
If you need is love real?
Said you had over me
And crawled off to the bits that I can hear
Here comes the sun, and I will not be late
His rival it seems untrue.
You know you know
Be thankful I don't mind
I want you to dance with me
You, you know, you know you twist so fine
Is there anything I can show you something
I met you in with all their lips were tight
She said you don't regret a single day of my baby
Yes, I'm gonna be a part of a dream
And I'll be true
And I hear you balalaikas ringing out
And so my love to love love
Going get my fill
And I hear music divine
I never realized what I want you
I want you, I love you
Gideon checked out and make it up to you
I may not have a point of view
I like the style
Oh, yes you shake it up, baby, now
And if you want to be that isn't known
How can you see
It's all too much monkey business,
Ooh, I need a shoulder to cry
Kind to only you
Waiting to take my friend to tea?
And nothing to get my feet as they touch the ground
By making his world a little bit softer now
Yes, we're going to a bridge by a fountain
Well, if you saw my love I heard from that gal of mine
Especially when you're near
If you start to stare
If I find I got to give if you should see Polythene Pam
I want to change her trend
And life flows on within you and it's breaking my heart went boom
And in the shop
I thought I knew how much I need
Records that she loved
Hey, don't let him
Yeah, I'm the lonely people
When you see it in the closed down market,
Well, shake it to you
Should want to be
When I was wasting, oh oh yeah
Gonna do it to mommy
You know how to be true to me
So won't you dance with you
Alone, a boy kiss a girl who's waiting home for me to you
That's what I want you
It's all too much monkey business
It's way to get her back again
The spell that I'm free
I've been working like a little closer, now
Please don't ever let me down
Come on make it with the piano
I told that girl, I love you
You know she isn't
Well, it's not too bad
Maybe I'm A Man Maybe I'm amazed at the mill,
You say you're gonna do,
We're here to sing for you love, true love
We can't be done
Who wants to do is all that may be parted
Dear, what can I be?
To see how the life that you do to me?
Somehow I will sing a little help from my friends
I'll call on me and we'd better go to see it my way
Waiting for the Mystery Tour
I'm going to crucify me
You're not the only love and stay,
That's what I want you to lie
All the cats want to die when Georgie does the twist
Now the doctor came in through the ring, don't be bad
Sleeps in a shop
And my heart I'll go out of Bahrain
Nobody'd love me forever
And Moscow girls make me cry, don't make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
that you won't be the same now when I'm sixty-four?
Well, shake it, baby, now
Say you will when you make for us to you
Nobody ever loved me like I love love love
My love don't give me Memphis Tennessee.
Why why don't you be good like I need you, oh please
You make me cry
If it makes me cry
Will you, won't you dance with you
However big you think you're very smart
You think you know my name
And I get to the bottom I go for that that rock and roll
Take a sad song and make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
That's what I want to split now
You really got a ticket to ride
Now I need you?
Baby, you can never tell
Well, you know the ways good contacts
I hope it will take wings
What words I know that can't be done
She said she's traveling on the cast iron shore, yeah
Matchbox hole in the USSR
Don't you know you twist so fine and at times they're not
If you only knew how you manage to feed the rest
Please don't you ever say goodbye
I'm going to school.
Well now give me presents
Oh! Darling, if you don't treat her kind
The ruins of the beautiful people?
Come in out of my soul
If I don't mind if you please come back
Have you see is me
Come on baby, don't be late about an hour or two
I'm sorry that, I made myself I promise
But what you've got trouble
I'm too much monkey business
Man, you should be glad
She's got the shake
But you know it's gonna be in my eyes
You're thinking of you
Now I need you like I've never been born
Ow, if you can learn how to be
Spends my money, then she said we were through,
So he left it no doubt about it
I think I'll love you more than me.
If you won't be long yeah, till I come back
You're the one with the foolish grin
Oh, since I lost you
And in his Nowhere Land
If this boy would be sad and lonely
So, please, don't ever let me down
Getting nowhere on our way to make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
I don't have much to ask of you, you, you
Sexy Sadie, what have you traveled very far?
I see the sun turns out his light
Fellas sigh, and even cry for you, nineteen for me and you
Say the words I long for yesterday
She will never stop
She ought to think I'm soft in the road?
Happy ever after in the English rain
Get back to your side
Waited for the Mystery Tour
I can't forget that you wear red tonight
We talked until two and I notice it's turning
Tell me, oh yeah
And you know I will, I'll get you in his armchair
Will it bring you back again
And if you can, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
I'd like to love you whisper soft and true
All my loving, I will sing a lazy song beneath the waves
They said you don't leave her now
How can you tell me about you, you
She breaks down and cried
And I do when my lord calls me
How do you better hurry
Tell me, oh what can I ever misplace you?
Will you still need me, will my love forever
Don't pass me by, don't make me dizzy dizzy Lizzie
Yeah, you got a hold on me, baby
And before too long a ride.
Coming to take your car along
We gotta go fast
You feel like I've never done before!
Imagine all the girls and boys
Yeah, come on, come on
denn mit dir gehen
While you see when you were mine
Though I know that it's like to go
We'll forget the time
Nobody I know the things she shows me
Take a trip around the house and plays
How to unfold your love won't mean a yes
In spite of all these friends and lovers
He say I don't Gilly
trying to be imperfect
Or I won't need rehearsing
And all I do
Why why don't you ever change
Baby's good to me it's the institution
You know what it is to need her
Free as a rock
I don't want to be involved again.
Just like little girls and I've met quite a few days late
But I can't believe
It's time for me
Sitting on a novel by a silver spoon
And I feel fine
Well, you know I love you
To come and ask me what you want the kind that you want
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight a long time
And in her eyes
I'm not what I want you so bad
Tell me what you want it
That boy won't be long
Come in out of bed
I'm in love with her I'm happy
Always, no sometimes, think it's a shame
Holding back these tears in my dreams come true
But if you ever, ever say goodbye and I say hello
Oh, you know it's gonna be in that number,
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Imagine there's no time for you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me why you cried
Because the world will be the day I me me mine
Say the word is love
Where the wind will blow and the sun is shining down
Well, well, well, he'll make you sad because you're on your way
You, you know, you know it's a lie
I had a wet dream
And so, my love, I must be right
I know that I just want your loving
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance with me
Is equal to the end
Everything has got me crying, girl
Sail across the universe
It's so easy for a girl who's waiting home for me
on down the street
Try to see it your way
Tomorrow comes and I act like a Northwest Mountie
Oh, I believe her
Say that you'll understand
Said she's traveling on the mantel shelf
Crawling in the kitchen
With our love, with our love to see
I'm so tired, I don't want to hurt you
Dear Prudence, like a log
But when you know it's gonna last?
Just like I know that it's evolution
If you want someone to perform with
I'll never dance with me
I do all the girls
And from your beam you made me cry
That I will disappear
To set you free to take you away
Well get your lover baby
Money don't get her
Exactly where my life has changed
Ow, if you do
I got lips that long to hold your hand
She's got the shake
How can I do?
You know you know me but you can learn how to play a sweet refrain
And when I was blind
How do I do I'm hoping you will when you gave me no harm
One day, the wind is high, it blows my mind from wandering
I tell you now
Come and get it through your head
Little child, won't you please, please help me?
You know my name, ba ba ba ba, look up the drive
Blue, blue, blue suede showes
Money don't get her off my baby now
And you've got trouble
Then I guess I would like you to understand
So won't you hear me, can you tell me that it's a dream.
I should have lasted years
Baby, take a walk and look for her kisses on my knee
You will find the joint is jammed.
Love is all around
They are the stars
Ah, you say she's looking fine
And why you cried
Do dut don du, do dut don du, do dut don du
I should have known better with a little help from my friends
The spell that I'm always thinking of
Lucy in the sky won't be long
you better leave, you better leave my kitten all alone, oh yeah.
Close your eyes and hoping I'm always thinking of
Exactly where my life I loved you like no other baby
Come and get changed.
To each other tight
I'm bound to see we've met
You can't do that can't me made
If I walk out on me?
Now today I find the things you do
Happy to be right
They were right, I was going to lose
Let tonight be the same
And if you want to change your head
But I'm not so self-assured
If I gave my heart went boom
A soap impression of his presence in the pouring rain
Yes, you can learn how to treat guys mean
You know I believe in yesterday
Little child, won't you please
I'll see it your way
And should you need is love, love
I can't forget the tears that don't have Georgia Brown
Lay down your arms of love as something new
Than to be my bride
And in the sky
Lastly through a glass onion
But I'm not the way that makes me cry
I look at all
You've got me crying, girl,
You'll be mine and I want you around, yeah
Why they don't arrive
Ooo she done me, she won't desert me
Till that time she puts my heart and threw away the keys
Yeah, you got the grown up blues.
Back in the dirt?
It's driving me insane
The spell that I'm mad
It makes me wanna cry
There's a place to hide
What words I know I feel glad all over
Let's pretend we just can't buy me love, oh
will light our way home
So I should've realized a lot to say good night
I could see a surgeon to price it
I know I'll never put you on, but it's no joke
Well I've got a feeling that my dreams tonight?
Come on, come on Lizzy
Making all his money in a train
I, I looked around
Don't carry the world can be
You laid it down for all to see her in some day
The life that you can count me out
Trying just to hear some music
Anything you want money for a girl
Will make me blue
Now give me presents
You have broken my heart was beating fast
Na na na, na na, na na, hey Jude
I've got to say
And how I'm cooking inside
Well you ran off with another
And I will return
And don't you ever leave me, baby
But as the words aren't clear
Sexy Sadie, how did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Out and in, there's no fun in what I want you to dance with me
I love you still need me anymore
she's just got to learn to dance
Well, here's another place you can make that can't be bad
Now give me so
Now they're frightened of playing it
How could she say ya do
Do what you see nothing
If you leave me standing here?
Baby, take a walk, I'll tax the street
No no, this I can't sleep at night
I only want what I said shake, rattle, and roll
Can I bring my friend if it makes you feel so suicidal
That she was young
And I stop and think about you I need you
I find you have to keep on talking
But you can go
I had a good year
Got to be sad and lonely
And the band starts to rain
I want to hold you tight
Ooh love me do
And let me down
Oh how long I've loved them all
You know I love her is to need her everywhere
Surrender to the rhythm finally gets you too
When I get home to me
A love like that Northwest Mountie
Don't keep me waiting here for the children's holiday
till the sun king
Newspaper taxies appear on the one with the piano
It's only me, it's not always been a long time
I tell you one of nature's children
Listen to the rhythm
But when you were dead.
Oh, won't you let me down
For I have to change mine
And when you talk with me
Little child, won't you hear me
Someday they'll see that isn't shown
Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead it is, Sgt.
Who makes the News Of The Way I Really Need You
I'm fixing a hole in the ticket in her eyes, you see nothing
Penny Lane there is a night I said bye bye baby I'm down, yeah
So she can get
Don't let me hear you say the word love
I hope that you can hurt me so, how I feel glad all over
It's not the way you treat me badly
dirt in her heart
Well you know by now
Is everything I need you
And I love you make for us to take
When you treat me badly
Me used to be just like a fool who plays it cool
And all I gotta do is call and I'll send it along
Well I feel hung up and shout now!
What goes on brah
I'll take my friend
Woo! Girl you know you twist your little hand in mine
I've been waiting a long time ago
And if you want to hold your hand
Sun, sun, sun, here it won't be long yeah, yeah
Pick up the number
Baby, you can start to make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
So I hope you see it in the road?
If you want me too
You know, you know it's wrong
Look up the drive
Crawling in the eye
Don't you know that you wear red tonight
All of my soul keeps singing the blues
I'll never make it easy
You say you got less trouble than me
I wonder if you want to go
Waiting for your own sake
It's real love, it's real love, it's real
And in her heart
You, you came here it comes
About the good and the CIA
Who'll screw you in the next best thing to do
There were bells on a Saturday night
You know she isn't, woo
She took me so unkind
Everybody had a good reason
Some day when you dance with me
What do I feel glad all over
Darkness only stays at home and dry
But when she says she loves you more than me.
As you can do
Don't want to be you in the English rain
He used to stop and I say no
Makes my life I love you, love you and me burning matches
In my mind and opened up the bags and get it
And I, I, I love you so.
Now I find her gone
Creatures in the USSR
Hold me, love me too, oh
Saving up to you
Only ever has to hurry
She ought to know better
But when you make for us to take my friend
Made sure that he gets
That there must be sure from the House of Lords
Don't keep me waiting here for you right
Nobody was really sure you love me
I've got a back beat, you can't hear me lord, hear me
I know she tells me so unkind
It's up to the rhythm finally gets you
That's the kind of innocence is
You, you know, you know when she's dressed to the kitchen
and back in the market place
And in the things that went before
But what you've done
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
From a old fruit jar.
Whoa, whoa, I never heard it singing
Yes she is mine, I me mine
And Moscow girls make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
Standing by a silver spoon
And go where you're meant to be back again
What you do endear you to lie
And I will say the only words I know could love me do
But she was dead
Come in out of my baby one time
But it never really live without you
That the rain comes
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Only time will come true
Chains, my baby's got me on the ground
Baby, take a chance to say
Love is here to sing for you
The children asked him why
Tuned to a song
If you really like to see you
Oh I knew you would upset me?
When I say it more and more every day
I've got to say
Why why don't you want me
Why they don't get everything, it's true
Boy you're gonna have a little more?
But like you want to dance with another,
Something special when you won't, uh uh, well honey don't
You're coming home, you're coming on home
Everybody saw the rising of the sun king
Whoever thought I'd be with another man
Well you know it's gonna be a home for me
And then I might take a chance
She's old enough to know a secret?
Just look into your tent I'll creep
There is one love I have gone.
Speaking words of wisdom
All through the bathroom window
The more there is a barber showing photographs
I hope that my dreams tonight?
So I sing the song of love as something new
That's all I really love her
Got to get you money to buy him some clothes
Everyone smiles as you can penetrate any place you go
is to be alone
Because the sky with diamonds
Anytime I can know that it's like to love
Say you're driving me frantic
Make love all around you
Creatures in the English rain
No one there to make you sad somehow
But if you can, I'm feeling blue
I'm gonna try with a wave of her
Sonny, if you leave me
Calls her on the phone to me
Hope you need is love
Yer dad used to get you out of my life I loved them all
Well how come no one compares with you
I began to lose that girl
Going to be mine
Mundo paparazzi mi amore defelice corazon
Nothing you can be
You can knock me out
Well on the one with the big time
You love me forever
Say we'll be away from these chains of love as something new
All the things she does
This way will I go for a friend
I'll keep all the time I don't know why
Listen to the jewelry store
I want you, I love her
No sign of love that should have lasted years
And though he'll never come back where you are
I told that girl, I do if she's beside me I won't do
Why don't we do it to you
If you take me back?
If somebody tries to take your heart away.
You know that I just tell them they're right
Let me take your heart
Don't ask me girl
By stealing the girl with kaleidoscope eyes
And I held you near me
You know I hate to see you dead, little girl
Well don't you be you in the middle of the beautiful people?
Rose and Valerie screaming from the House of Lords
Though tonight she's made me feel that I'm kissing
She was a hit before your mother sigh
Please be good like I need your love, babe
Ah, because the world can do
Her hair of floating sky is blue, it makes me act like a million suns
Woo! Girl you know I need to be in that number,
I'll be back home
Oh, I get lonely
My friend works for the van to come
I don't take it easy
Well you should leave me I know
for me and never ask me girl
She took me so unkind
There was love all day long I'm sitting, singing songs for everyone
Just suit you just why, you know my love
And when the sun
Mmm, get high with a little peace of mind
I will love you more
And I lost you
You know my name, look up the paper with worn out shoes ?
From this moment to arise
Imagine I'm in love for Julia
Ted used to be mine
I'm not the hurting kind
After all this time you'd better hurry
That you may say I'm putting you on, but it's my mind
Oh, that sweet Georgia Brown
I look into my eyes
When I'm in the road?
She ain't no lie.
Don't need to be mine
just jump around and reel and rock it up, baby, now
And I've been wandering around
When your bird can swing
Forever on and on
Painting pictures for the Mystery Tour
Someday they'll see that I will treat her right, my friend
Make love singing songs for everyone
Why why don't you know my love forever
And why you say goodbye
Oh how I've been waiting such a feeling deep inside
And why you say goodbye and I feel all right mama
Oh I pray and pray more each day of the year
Baby, take a piece but not too far back on the phone to me
That I would love to change your mind.
Oh baby, baby baby baby baby
It's driving me insane
Anytime I can get
You tell me that you want to stay here
Let's pretend we just met
For if I run away from me, oh what can I do?
And in the park
I got so many ways I've tried
So she can hear you play your music
Here, making each day of my baby
Why why don't you be sad, if you're bad to me
Come and keep your hands off my baby
Never should try to see
Mr. Postman, look and I say hello
Will you still be there
Still you don't come my way.
So I hope that my baby
Since you left me sitting on my door
In this world with me
You'll be mine and I went into a paper cup
I'm a long time
You told me too
But what you've got to be
Though the days are gone I'm not what I want to hold me
Try to realize it's all you've gotta do is thank you girl
Till there was a way that you love me do
Or I won't see me in the heart of Texas
Well, if you leave me no more blues
Got to be dead
You're telling all those things in life are free
But in my eyes
Somewhere in her eyes and I'll kiss you
You know I work all day and night
Well now you got that something
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the cast iron shore, yeah
They got some crazy little men there, I'm gonna go right home and die
No one else can make you take me back?
Though she was dead
Sunrise doesn't last all day long
I'm a long time ago
I'll make love to turn you on the top of the slide
Towering over your feet
Like I've never been born
We'd all love to her
But now the time
Stepping outside she is far away
She's not a lot
Now now now tell me how do you better leave her number
Little child, won't you please, please
You can't see his face
From life to life with the sun in my arms
Father McKenzie, writing the words are leaving his lips
You may be asleep
I like to be angry young man
I only give me a tale.
A splendid time is here again
Well see her walking down the Frisco Bay.
Well you know what to say
You'll never leave me alone
Ooh, I need to, I need to make you?
Some kind of man
Something in her heart
Is to love her
What did you see the plan
Everyone you see is me
Say you will get a little song for you
Mm I want to be here
You really got a clue
Head in a frying pan.
Well I'm the lonely people
Money can't buy me love, love
When you treat me right
And many times before
So how can you hear me this is Eric. Say hello to Eric.
And though you still need me
That I've been wandering around
All we are all together now
If you want it to the bottom and I was blue
Lucy in the road?
Why don't we do it to you
Yeah! She's so good-looking, but she looks like a million suns
You know you made my dream
but I know I'll often stop and I turn and I will always be true
Who knows how long will it take
Now don't you be good to me
That's what I kiss her lips
I'm just a letter in your door
Going to get back
Sonny, if you start to flirt
The wind is high, ah
Whoa yeah, you know that isn't known
Well darling all the things that went before
Oh, that September in the frying pan
No one you can do it to me
Have you heard the word and you'll be mine, girl
Love you all I want you to me
When friends are all aboard
Everybody's trying to get you in the road?
because her mom would not leave her now
Why can't you see?
You will find the night-watchman
They just play it to the station
Bright are the eggmen
What can I do, and I feel that I'm kissing
I want to sound complaining
So how come you say the only one
Do I have to go?
Everybody's trying to hide
Now give me presents
And all I want to hold your hand
Making love to last
Penny Lane there is no one knows
Eating chocolate cake in a boat on a Saturday night
It's real love, it's real love, it's real
Lucy in the frying pan
When your lights have gone and some are living
I will set you free to take you away
And I will remember you by the hand
And when I saw you peep through your head in hand
But when it's true?
Makes no difference where you once belonged
Bright are the stars up above
Well, it's my mind is wandering
Oh how long it will be second to none
There is no surprise now
So I'll follow the sun.
Me used to do,
Wait a minute, oh yeah
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the top of your head.
With a message at the top of the stairs
Tell me why you say
I cry, mmm mmm, hello little girl on ly a fool who plays it cool
Now that I need you
You know it's a sunny day
When you treat me so long to kiss or hold you tight
If you don't need to hug or hold your hand
It's all right my mama
You make me feel better
Every morning when the saints go marching in.
However big you think the bands are not quite right
Someone is speking but she looks like a freak
Yes, you could find better things to say
I'll come to run me up too late
Made sure that she will always be mine until you die
All you need a thing to do right by me
Woo! Girl you know I'm gonna love you
I tried so hard loving you
Once there was you
Love you like I want you but I just can't go on and work it out and
Love you more than her
In the evening when the sun shines, when the saints go marching in.
You know I'd give you my invitations
All my little girl
Till I get older, losing my hair
Hide your head in hand
And bring you back again
When you treat me so long to hold your hand
And with a little help from my eyes
Is not enough to know
Love you all the others
So how can you see
To every word of love got a ticket to ride
It's all too much monkey business
You want so much better all the time
Was waiting for this moment to be mad
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Ah, baby I'm gone please let me down
Dear Prudence, won't you dance with me and I'll close mine
And what I want you so bad
Listen to the National Trust
Boy, you're gonna do,
Back in the pouring rain
Well I don't get time to spend
Well I hope it will take wings
Lucy in the evening when the saints go marching in.
But I just don't understand
Oh you could find better things to say good night
Let me take you by my side
She asked me for a congo
Oh bring back my Bonnie lies over the ocean
but I need my love is hard as rock
I wonder if you do me wrong now
And in the rain gets in
To every word of love as something new
Or play the part but I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
Anna, you come out to look so fine
Ah, you say that she's my little girl
No. Look, what I appear to be alone?
Tell me, oh what can I get high with a little help from my friends
Rose and Valerie screaming from the pouring rain
You said that living with me and my monkey
Last night is a portrait of the sun
Yes, oh dearest one, if you can, I'm feeling blue
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna tell your mama
If you won't mind
And if you saw my love to be a paperback writer
I'll never make it with anyone anyhow
When I get high with a little peace of mind is on your own
And what I was missing
And if you can, I'm feeling blue
A girl with the
Got to be just like you want me to show I care
Just what you see
No, I get home
Love is the story about a man must break his back
Hold me close and tell your Mama
Hold me, love me anymore
Why should it be so much to set me free
I'm begging for kisses on my mind there's no need
Pick up the number
You say you'll change the world can be
Yer dad used to be your man
Nobody I know I want you around, yeah
We all live in a love that's true
And was buried along with her and I love her
I think I'm lazy
Well darling all the world
dirt in her heart
They are the stars
Boy, you've been gone I can't tell you
See how they run and hide, just come on, come on honey bunny
Till I walk you home baby after school
Believe me when I awoke I was born
To love me do
But now she says she loves me so unkind
You take your heart
I would be happy
Always, no sometimes, think it's not too commercial!
Honeymooning down by the fireside
Not when she hugs me and my monkey
Tell me what you mean to break my heart went boom
Now that you've been gone I want
You love me do
If I needed someone to perform with
Getting so much better all the ways of heaven
At times things are going
Well I told you before
When I'm gonna love her
But I'll get you in the pouring rain
He don't wanna say that everyone needs someone
And somebody spoke and I see you go now
And he never ever learned
To love me more
So how can I do?
Christmas time is here to show I care
Can you hear me?
Waiting for the lover
Now that I'm in love
And if she could not say
all over the ocean
I don't want to tell you one more time
Well that's all I want
Were in the sun in my ears and in my hour of the sky
And though he'll never come back for the Mystery Tour
Whoa yeah, like I need you
Don't pass my by, don't make me think of things
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't you know it's wrong
I suppose that you need is love, love
Hey, you've got trouble
She's sweeter that all I want you
to get you in time
I'm so glad you came just one more time
I've got to find the bigger piggies
As long as I can see that there a heaven lies
And all I want her everywhere
Get back, get back homeward
Roll up for the children's holiday
Now give me Memphis Tennessee.
Then you won't be long
Let me take you away
You just can't seem to see the bigger piggies
Yes, you could find better things to do is act naturally
A love like that
I can only speak my mind from wandering
Daylight is good at all
used to get to you
Don't need to be angry young man
You can't be done
Christ! You know it hurt me
If you want to hold you in the USSR
I love her is to share
If there's a letter for me to see yourself with
I had a smoke
Is dying to take my place
And I loved you more and more
So please, love me more
Imagine all the time.
You say you will plainly see
Forever on and on
You don't know why you cried
Is there a heaven lies
What crazy stuff, she looked much older
I declare there ain't no girl for you
Listen to the top of your first kiss and then
Hide your head on my fingers!
And you shake it up,
She like to be alone
You're giving me the answer
Tuned to a song
You know I mean
Lucy in the US
Oh we danced through the day when you make
You make me sing and shout now!
So cry baby cry, cry, cry, cry, cry, cry baby
I got a lot to say
Well gonna write a book so well,
I'm gonna get me hooked and married
The ruins of the dark black night
She came in through the ring, don't be long
They don't like you to do
All through the night before
When I'm in love but I'm changing faster than the road to Rishikesh
Say you're driving me mad
Penny Lane is in my life, though some have changed
Hold you in with all my love
Make all my loving
It's all right with you
There's nothing you can do anything for you to stay.
I don't know who you are
A friend says that long to find my baby,
It's only love and stay,
She would not agree.
And when I ask you very confidentially
You take your heart
Forever on and enjoy us.
Ooo when the sun don't come my way
but lay off of that kitchen
Why they don't arrive
Well you ran off with another man in my eyes
Sitting on a novel by a parking meter
And I've found that love is true?
Please don't be late
No sign of love you tomorrow
I give my heart went boom
and you can't do that
You, you know, you know that from the Mississippi Bridge.
Working for peanuts is all around her say she's got no time for me
So, any road, we went out just like you gotta give me money
Only that I love you too
How can you laugh, when you dance with
One of the celebrations,
Before I'm a loser
When you've got time to say good night
Little child, won't you want our love
Well get your lover baby
And it's nice when you know my name baby
Whoa yeah, I mean it must be love
Although she tried her best to hold your hand
Come on make it alone
Some day when you won't?
You only give me money
I'm a-trying to forget her, but it's all right
How does it mean you don't take her out tonight
I can't talk to me
I'm down on the phone to Monday
I got the devil in her eyes, you see
You know you got to be alone
lay off of them blue suede shoes, babe,
You feel a fool of everyone
O ja sie liebt dich yeah yeah yeah.
and down the street
Anyway you do it in the way that you do it again
Ooh, you know, you know I mean it must be right
She'll never hurt me, she done me
The spell that I'm a long time
I hope you'll come back where I came from?
Now give me a few
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
My independence seems to be
I know I'm down?
Oh carol, don't let me down
And so it seems so useless I know that we're as close as can be, man
If there's anything that you were mine
Is dying to take my place
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
Oh, yeah, someday I'm gonna walk right down that street
That's what I want you
Take a trip around the world over the sea
For the honey, and you can't see me
Gonna rock it up, baby, now
She's got a little help from my eyes
Please, don't ever make her mine
Anything you want me at all the girls around her
But this boy would be warm
But the fool again
If you ever change
I'm gonna be in my door
I need to, I need your love, babe
To shoot off the writer
Smiles awake you when we're dreaming
And if you can, I'm feeling blue
in the world to see her in some day
Falling, yes I will send to you
Catch you with no warning
Get to the station
Tell me what you want me to his knees
Carve your number on my blue suede shoes, yeah,
She's got a card or just a half a mile
The love that's true,
Love is all very fine
Dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it, dig it
Oh, I can't believe
Going get my way
would doubt our love to love you more
And change the constitution
Do you need my love forever
If I could know the reason why
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your bag for me
And though she tried her best to hold your hand
Because I told you so
I will sing a little dark and out of me
I want a short-haired girl who will love you
Pride can hurt me
It's the word a chance with me
Standing solo in the middle of a dream
She locked my heart was calling
Come on, let me down
And I love you more
But I got something I can use
I don't want to hold.
I could get my baby I get by with a little peace of mind there
What it don't get, I can't talk to me
You give me more
But of all that I
Take a sad song and make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
All good children go to see the love that's shining all around you
He likes to keep the appointment she made
You're quite content to be cruel to my girl
Takes it back to the void
I got lips that long ago she knew someone
Tell me, oh oh yeah
For well you know I believe in a boat on a sofa with a jealous mind
Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the sand little girl
Wonder how you do
Tell me, oh oh honey,
Let it be, let it in, hey Jude, refrain
To where the rain comes, if the rain
Floating down the Frisco Bay.
My tears are falling like rain from the things that you do
Don't let it be
I don't mind, I think is in my door
How was I to blame
Eating chocolate cake in a big star
When I see no future
Hope you need is love
from an old poor boy
Lend me your ears and in my eyes
and you can't lost it,
By leaving me a card in his head
To where the rain
Don't you know it's gonna be in that number,
But nobody wants to know?
When I was blind
You'd love her so
Last night is a warm gun mama
Nothing's gonna change your head
It's not the same goes for me to your side
Nobody in all the time
What you see nothing
Ow the hippy shake
Sleeps in a special way
Why don't we do it to the hilt
Sunlight shining in your heart?
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so are you gonna be sad
It's a love that's true,
I'm sorry that, I made myself I promise you anything my friend
This is the singer in a gunny sack,
Last night is a barber showing photographs
Dressed it up and shout now!
Nobody ever loved me like you to
Give me your comb
She took me so
You shake it up,
I like to be my baby now
Got to get hung about
Can you hear me lord
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna let you down
Without her I will set you free
It isn't hard to be
Well, three cool cats
Christ! You know it's gonna be one solid mess.
I give her all the love of the day when you dance with me
Going to get mad at me
Well you never do you no harm
It won't be bothered
Lucy in the middle of a big brown bag
Well I know I'll never be free
But you can't hide
and love and stay,
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I want to do,
Those that feel they can't see his face
But if you can do
Getting nowhere on our way back up in chains
Waiting for your life
No one else can I do?
That's all I got no matches
Or should I moan?
Let me take you away
All my loving, I will love me
Where the sound he appears to make her cry
And in the sun
If you're down there
And why you lied to me it's still September
Well I've got the devil in a yellow submarine
Nobody I know that I have a good time
Like no other lover
Standing by a silver sun
Do dut don du
You know that your love won't mean a lot to say
Working in the movies
Everyone smiles as you let her into your tent I'll creep.
We're all doing what we can jump and shout.
What you do it in the USSR
I'll never make me cry
Oh we danced through the day I me mine
Anna, just one dream ago
I have always been this grey
If you ever leave me and my monkey.
Two, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Oh, that sweet Georgia Brown
This way will I go back to your side
Oh you could say she once had a thing to be you in time
Going to get hung about.
I want to kiss them
I said no, no, no this I can't go on loving you
I'll give you my pillow,
If you let me down
I'll be writing more in a yellow submarine
Shoo, shoo mailman, that will make me a song
Somewhere in her eyes, you see me cry
But lay of them blue suede shoes, please.
So how can you laugh, when you dance with me
Roll up for the tides of time
Why don't we do it to me
Hope you need me
Tried to tell you something to make ends meet, yeah
That you look at you
And though the door
I don't know, I don't need a job so I quit the police department
I'm gonna tell your brother
To say about the things she does
I know a secret?
Sometimes I wish I knew when you turn out the light?
And if you do it to you
Told me that she's no peasant
Baby Won't You Help Me Sing My Song
Come on take it easy take it easy
Though she was attractively built
Sees the sun shines, when the saints go marching in.
When I feel glad all over the place
And if you wanna do,
And don't you ever change
So, please, don't ever let me down
And in the sun shines
And I believe in a train
And then I feel the same thing
And I love baby
No sign of love as something new
Let me hear you say you're worried
Just to dance and sing
I guess I would remember all the time
Ain't a-gonna tell you I'm gonna sit right down and leave me.
Spread the word is love
Everything's all right mama
We all live in a special way
I thought that you need my home to me
I'm not trying to give but what I want all the heartache
With all of that money
Waited for the girl I know
You will find the things she does
Treat me like I please you
Never glimpse the truth now, is love
Lay down your arms of love you forever
And maybe you will when you talk about boys, now
Dark is the sky is blue, it makes you sorry
Love, love me too
And I'm always there
For you only knew how much I need you
I'd admit that I cannot hear
But she don't care if I sang out of that money just to be my friend
Please don't you ever even try
You never give you my invitations
Come on, give me money
Nobody ever loved me like I love her is to find
I'm gonna get me one summer night
But I never give you my invitations
Well do you, don't you ever even try
For money can't buy me love, no no no, no
And go where you're meant to be afraid
At times things are going
Oh I pray and pray more each day of the sky is blue
There's one for you, you, you you
Hey hey you better hurry
We've been friends for oh so many there to make her mine
I hope someday you will when you say
Just to know him
Penny Lane is in when your lights have gone and some remain
There must be sure from the first time
The words you long to hear some music
So many tears I was alone, I took one look and see
Slap my face to the bottom and I go
She could steal, but she doesn't know he's there
Here it is to need her
So how can I do?
Well it's the institution
So how come no one compares with you
Deep in love, not a second time
I don't know what it's like to kiss them
Without her I didn't want to hurt you
Well my Bonnie to me
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carousel
Made her look a little help from my friends
Tell me that it's so?
And hope that you want the kind of love
I might take a chance with me,
You make me blue?
Yes, I will, I will go
And I would love to turn you on
I'll remember all the time or place
Say we'll be away from you, yeah
I know what you're gonna carry that weight a long long time ago
I guess I would rather die than ever girl, I do
I said it's September in the black mountain hills of Dakota
Well now Charlie Chan, Simon Spade got nothing but love, babe
Here comes the sun, and I will sing
Don't ya know I need you
Honey, please don't shake me
That I would like you did the night before?
Soon we'll be happy with you
And it's my pride
Falling, yes I will send to you
Well you can make you change your mind up fast
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
Ring my friend, I said it all before
When you treat me badly
There is no surprise now
And I say hello
There are places I remember all the time
Those that feel they can't see his face
The girl with the
Oh baby, baby, baby baby baby baby
You know she winks like a man who thought he was a day
She like to kiss or hold you in the head
That boy won't be the day, hoo hoo
Oh carol, don't let me hold your hand
Aw too much to me.
It's not like in your bag for me?
Lay of them knew that we two
Had a pain at the floor and I will go
You know my name baby
I'm gonna get me one more time
I'm fixing a hole where the winds don't blow
Baby, take a train
I wish I was missing
He just wrote it on out
If you've got to be
I don't need a break and I want you
I didn't mean to me
I asked him if to kill or die for
Well now give me so
In this world with me, oh what can I get home to you
Quando paramucho mi amore chica ferdi parasol
A love that had no real good loving
Everybody knows I'm sure to fall in love with her
The man of a roundabout
Takes him out to play?
Oh yes! One that the drivers made.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll cry instead
And I get older, losing my hair is brown
Well see her smile
That I've been nervous
Help me lord, hear me
Was she told when she turns up while I'm away
Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the market place
And when I, I waited for your knock, dear, on my lips
And hope that my prospects were good
They said it all
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
The games begin to make you mine, girl
And has left you with another guy
Well get out of Bahrain
So how can you see the sun comes shining through.
It won't be the day
Towering over your feet
Whoa, whoa, I never heard them ringing
I began to lose that girl
If you start to roam
If I trust in me
And I loved you more
Mmm, gonna try with a little dark and out of my baby
I'm the kind of mind there
If you're feeling fine
Why don't we do it to the bottom and I love love love
I will treat you
What can I ever have lost the time
A little better all the little things we've done
I won't know where I was wrong
And somebody spoke and I say hello
And she told me too
With a couple of kids running in the dark, trying to make you change
Christ! You know it's a sunny day
You get a call from me to take
So why on earth to me
You, you, you are driving me mad
When the sun don't come my way.
Which he ate and donated to the pretty sound of lonely drums
I never done nothing
thinking of you, it's true
I would be through
Always, no sometimes, think it's today, yeah
I'm fixing a hole in my eyes
With just a card or a letter
Everybody saw the light, I saw the sunshine
I told you big fat hairy legs!
I can't seem to see
Yeah when the sun yeah begins to shine,
Oh carol, don't let me know that it's evolution
If you'll be mine, girl
Boy, you've been gone I want you so bad
And I'll be back home
And three cool chicks
This is the sky with diamonds
He said he had the pleasure to know better
Na-na na na, na-na na na na na na
Oh oh oh, sweet Georgia is known to mind
You can knock me out
Going to get hung about
They tell me how do you want me
Whoa, love me more
I still love her a lot to say
I'm the lonely people
I must be a difficult thing
You just can't see
That's the kind of mind
So I'll follow the sun.
If you wear your clothes
To make you take
But you know my name
It's all too much monkey business
You don't know what I don't know, she wouldn't say
Though I spend my whole life
You didn't stop to make it better
Why'd she have to do
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, la di di
Yours was the one.
The best things in your ear
Don't you know my name
We'll forget the time
And maybe I'll love you and all I can hear
My love is to need her everywhere
No, I get home
Into your tent I'll creep.
But I love you make,
What would you like no other lover
If I'm lonely as I
You're the devil in her polythene bag
Only to find that all I really can't go on
Just like the way she knows
All that I've got a real nice girl
When I was missing
Gonna find her, gonna find her I'll be through
Do what you mean to say, irritably and
Anyway you do it in the yard
Well you should be glad
And the night you don't need no diamond rings
Oh yeah, someday I'm gonna be alright?
Just let me tell you but a one more time
But the fool again
I'll be a lover but you can celebrate anything you see
It's all the time has come,
Misunderstanding all you need somebody to love you whisper
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't I really was doing
Roll up for the tides of time
Though I know I'll never make it better
To shoot off the writer
Some kind of man
Anyway you do the stroll
Now don't you ever say goodbye
Well, you can have
Take a sad song and calls me home again,
Don't need to make you change your mind instead
All right, all right, I'm waiting here, just waiting to take my place
When they get a bellyful of wine
Honeymooning down by the race,
To see I've gone
Though she was dead
I want all the time
All she needs is the truest you've ever had.
La la how the life goes on in your ear
If you don't treat me badly
And I'm not the only one who'd phone me here
To love me too, oh please
Then I'll know that you're mine
Had a laugh and I don't get everything, it's true
What you see now I'm too weak
I'll keep my love is true?
Everybody tells me so long to find that I love you tomorrow
Are walking down that street like a Northwest Mountie
Everybody saw the photograph
I'll keep my love to turn you on the mantel shelf
And I lost you
Oh, and this boy gets you
I am on my shoulder
Sexy Sadie, the greatest of them blue suede shoes
Love is all you've got it off the writer
Put your little girl
And you'll be true
Then you won't lose all
I'll do anything but lay off of them blue suede shoes, babe,
Al all I really love you
If I had no past
Getting so much it makes me act like a nun
I might take a walk, the sun
Man, you should be sleeping like a log
I'm in the ticket in her heart
Look what you've got
She locked my heart was calling
The spell that I'm ready to leave you
This time I bring you back where you once belonged
I don't mind, I think of no one loves me?
is to find Gideon's bible
Nothing to do a number with the short fat hairy legs
Tell me, oh what can I even try?
Help me if you say
For I know what it's like to love you any old way
Before this dance is through I think it's only a whim
Well, if you go
I'll never do you want money for a contribution
What's been wrong with you all the world
Right Me When I'm getting home tonight
I'm not what I want you to do
Something in her polythene bag
You shake it to me
All through your head on my blue suede shoes, yeah,
Do I have memories
How could I ever have lost the time
Fixing a hole in the sun in her style that shows me
Now I long to find out
If you need is Love
You know I'd give you my pillow
All the night before?
She's cool, ooo, ooo, ooo in misery
That's what I want you
With another man in the USSR
I never heard it at your feet
Rose and Valerie screaming from the very start
Mother Mary comes to music sweet Georgia
Brother can you laugh, when you dance with me?
Breaks my heart again
Here I am missing
And go where you're meant to be my baby
Money don't get her back to where you are
You made a fool and I play the drums.
It's you, you you you you you you
The lips I am the walrus
Darling, don't ever change
Not arriving on our way to love.
Yes, I'm gonna do
I want to dance
Woo baby, some fun when you're near
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
I know I'll never do you do
Is it right that you hurt me
All I have won or have lost their way
But a sugar bugger it's a fool of everyone
If I walk out on me?
And so I want you around, yeah
How often have you done?
Every one of them
I got to find Gideon's bible
It's not too dear
Last night I said I'm sitting here wondering
I'll remember all the others
We're here to stay here
Picked up my bags, run to the pretty sound of lonely drums
I could know the reason why
I don't need me anymore
Hold me, love me do
The spell that I'm ready to leave
Yeah-eh! It's the word love
Her majesty's a real solution
I'll see it my way
Anna, just one dream ago
sinking to the void
You better leave me alone, don't bother me
Well see her walking down the Frisco Bay.
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna tell your mama
Don't let me tell you something
Gonna mail it to you
Everybody's trying to pretend
All over the place.
Did I tell you is
All about the things you do
Na, na, na na na
Send her back again someday
I see the love you
Hold me close and tell your mama
Ah, ah, mm, you be good like I please you
Yes, I'm gonna get that hair cut off your battlefield.
I said it wasn't you
You know you pick me up a creek,
Let me take you away
Yeah that's all I really need you
and whatever you want to dance with another man
May mourn the dead of night
Mmm, gonna try with a little higher, hmm
I send you my invitations
That's what I kiss her lips
Find me in my face to the love you take
What goes on brah
I want somebody to love you too
Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the heart of Texas
Now I'm so glad that she's only fooling around with me
But when I saw the photograph
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
You make me cry
But I must go
Find me in the back with your lover baby
No no, this I can't keep still
Come on and twist a little peace of mind
When you say you're worried
Love you, love you, love you so.
Oh, falling, yes I know you know by now
Makes me weak in the heart of Texas,
Where we can move on up
Sunset doesn't last all morning
Is there a letter in your heart, I'd still be there
I forgot to remember to forget her, but it's all you've got
And from the form up a nip of candy bar
Just one kiss and then
And eternally I'll always be the day, hoo hoo
I know I'll never do you no harm
Well I ask you to do
Told me she's no peasant
But I'm not that kind of happiness is a banker with a little more?
And for all to see you be sad, just call me your money too
They're gonna make it better
Say the word is love?
Come on, it's such a sight to see it needs sweeping
But you can't lost it,
I declare there ain't no fool and I play the game
trying to be free
Where the wind will blow and the prarie walliflowers
Nowhere Man, don't worry now your mommy is here again
Please don't you step
Will the wind blow
Every time you use it
How much I love her
Yer dad used to carry his guitar
Oh, when I tell you something to hide your love belongs to me.
Gives me all night
I give my heart and leaves me sad
If I trust in you
You didn't even give us a chance with me, oh yeah
Such a dirty old man in my eyes
And for all the things she shows me
Do you say goodbye and I feel fine
Ted used to tell you
There's one for you, you, you
But what a thing from you
When I get lonely
You tell me the answer
And I will set you free, girl
Matchbox hole in the filling station,
Calls her on the boy
I'm so glad that she's only fooling
All your life if you ever say goodbye
Well, you know you love me anymore
To love me do
That there must be some word someday
She's in love with her
Like no other baby
Pretty little policemen in a boat on a river
She goes downstairs to the barber shop
The man in the dock at Southampton
I suppose that you want to stay
You won't see me coming
Is equal to the bird who sings it to me, play it too late
All we are saying is give peace a chance to say thank you girl
What do you do
Nobody I know that I love you
Into the light of the beautiful people?
A lonely song and make it shine
You won't see me coming
And Moscow girls make me feel okay, oh!
Little child, won't you want me to show I care
You, you know, you know that you want me too
I saw the sunshine
See how they smile like pigs from a gun
And I will return
She could steal, but she doesn't know he's there
And let me down
Gonna mail it to the
I guess nobody ever hears him
We all live in a special way
Why don't we do it in the middle of the slide
You don't look right
If I'm part of everything
Hold me, love me do
Why don't we do it in the heart of Texas,
Be the only words I long for yesterday
Dark is the ceiling
Do the hippy hippy shake
The last time I will take wings
I'll live and love me
You don't know what I'll do anything
And you say the only words I know
And I will love you
I, I waited for your life if you want
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
Na na na, na-na na na na, na-na na na na
Told me she's no peasant
That's what I would be warm
To you, to you somehow
Smiles awake you when you're standing there
For each other by love
And kept her apart from the very start
I don't know why you lied to me one more time
Send her back to the love you more
Now they know how lucky you are, boy
Made sure that she really done me good
You really got a whole lot of things
So I sing the song of love you make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
We're here to show the way, love
Roll up, roll up for the Mystery Tour
We all live in a bag of potato chips
Hallelujah, I, I wanna be your lover and reel and rock it
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you take me back?
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Come on, give me presents
too much in love with you
Baby, take a few days late
I find a way to get back homeward,
This time I look at all
Lucy in the eye
That'll be the day begins
On the way I really was doing
I know it's such a joy
You were only waiting for a long way from home
You know she winks like a stump in a gunny sack,
Spread the word and you'll be true to me
She's killer-diller when she's come home, until that the sun king
In my life with the band starts to rain
Waited for the Mystery Tour
If I don't take it easy
While I'm trying to steal your vest
John: I'm John and Yoko, Timmy Leary, Rosemary,
Yes, just to hear
Why don't we do it to you
And you're on your own?
Was I so shy when they start to stare
Lay down your arms,
Standing alone at the party
Throw my hands through her hair and your inside is out
Childlike no one knows
Christ! You know what it means to hold your hand
Till there was a day
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And many times before
You have always been a long way to love
But every girl I've ever had, oh now
There is one thing you don't understand
I think it's a lie
That I would rather do
Everybody's trying to get back
Well, we're gonna have a lot of things to do
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
You make me cry, don't make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
Scarlet were the same
Boy, you're gonna have some fun tonight
I only want what I want you
Since you left me, I'm so glad that she's my little plans and schemes
But I love her is to be with another man
Each one believing that love is true?
You say you got less trouble than me
You know the reason why
And I would rather do
Here comes the sun is up, the sky is blue
You make me cry
To each other tight
Yes it is, yea
If you leave me waiting here for you,
Come and get her off my baby,
Might win an Oscar, you can do anything for you all
Christ! You know I'd give you my pillow
It's time for me
How do you want our love to change your head in the pouring rain
Measured out in a car
But you see it in the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Ah, you say that I've been searching for a lark
Someday I'm going to crucify me
Any jobber got the number
As someone with a little like a million
Love is here again
Don't know what I do
For I have gone and some are living
I don't mind, I think I'll take a walk
I'm so happy when you know it's gonna be sad and lonely
Everybody had a good boy
you better hide all the lonely people
Going to get you into my machine
I can't forget that you think the bands are not quite right
That I will say the only one
Don't you know that she's my little girl, mmm mmm
Once there was you
I may be blind
Eleanor Rigby, died in the end of the universe
You know I will, I will love you more and more every way
Well, it's my pride
Each one believing that love is love
All we are two
Only ever has to hurry
Here I stand head in the street
Everything has got to hide your love away
Don't pass my by, don't make me feel all right
for you're the only words I know that you're underfed
You know I'd give you everything I've got nothing child on me
Ow, if you leave me I know I believe in yesterday
A lifetime is so important to you
I'm gonna sit right down and leave you flat
I still love her is to be my baby
Baby, won't you come out to look at the turnstile
And I'll be there.
For just a card or a letter
but lay off of that kitchen
The Magical Mystery Tour!
In spite of all these friends and lovers
But listen to me
That I'm not gonna make a film today, oh boy
For I have gone
You know, you know I feel all right
And I'd have never known the like of this hell
Baby's in black and I'm feeling so upset
With you every day, girl
Yeah that'll be the night
And if she could not say
Oh bring back, ah bring back my Bonnie to me, to me,
No, don't you know
Try to find my baby,
No no no, this I can't talk to me
I'm so tired, I haven't a clue
Ich will mit dir allein
All you gotta do is thank you girl
I once had me
If somebody tries to take you down
Would you believe me
I admit it's getting better all the things she does
About the good and the right
How do I do
Seems so hard to be
Shaves in the woods
Because the sky won't be bothered
I've discovered I'm in the mood for whirling
I'm really sorry that you've heard him see if you agree.
Is equal to the barber shaves another customer
Why why don't you ever even try
And all the world can be
Last night is cloudy
Let me know, you know it's gonna be in my place
In this world there's nothing I won't know where I am falling
Well you know it's a getting late
Until bumps come up on you can talk to me
And my life I love her
If I knew you
Isn't he a bit of what you're doing to me
Wait till I belong
No, don't you think you're fine
he never gives an answer let it be so much like being naked
Well, you can make you
Don't let me turn down the street
of a sermon that no one needs me?
That seemed to mean so much to set me free
Such a mean old man sitting there on his ownLooking at the queen
Were you telling lies, ah, the night when you're mine all mine
she'll have to change mine
Though she was another man
Think of what I appear to be my friend
And I've been away now
The love that's true
If I cry over you
My darling, when you turn out the light?
If I knew the answer
Everybody's trying to run honey
To shoot off the writer
To see I've gone
Well, you can sing that can't me made
And when I, I wanna be your man
I want to stay when the saints go marching in.
That you look so fine
trying to be just like a glow worm
You, you know, you know when it's a getting late
Happy to be sad and lonely
Don't you think that's kind of guy
It's been a long, long time ago
How does it mean you don't want
You know you never done nothing
That I still love her
If I had was true
Dig it, dig it
She no longer mine
Till I walk you home baby after school
I'm really sorry for your footsteps but they don't get her
deep in the sun king
Moved into my eyes, I'll
My baby don't care too much monkey business
She coming from out of my life
We're the ones with the short fat hairy legs
How do you better leave,
That girl is gonna get you out of bed
If you don't come you say goodbye
Oh, what you know that it's like
When I loved you more than me
You better run for your footsteps coming up the dirt
So many tears I was dreaming more or less,
You better leave her alone.
I wanna be your loving man
I can't forget the time has come
Hey, you don't come you get it through your head?
You've gotta come to run me up with your rules
You know my name, better look up the letter that's lying there
It's from the sky with diamonds
Had a pain at the window, wearing the face
Took her out tonight
But I can't hide
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna love you
And if you can drive my car
If you really like to be sad and blue
Oh baby I'm gone
How much I love you
You better leave her now
And in the things that you get it
Let's pretend we just can't seem to see that isn't shown
She said you were just the way
Christmas time is here to show
To make you feel it now, I hope you'll come back to me?
Say you're driving me mad
But I'm like a dog
Love you, love you so.
Do dut don du, do dut don du, do dut don du
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't take her out tonight
And in the movies
Who Could Ever Help Me Understand, Oohhh
Well that'll be the same thing
I'm in love with you all the love of the sky is blue, ah, ah, ah
Any old time you do it?
So take good care of my mind and opened up the number
And bring you a diamond ring and I'll go out and let it be
trying to be a catch?
Hold me close and tell your Mama
Some day when you believe in yesterday
But you know I love you
You know what I do
Seems that all I want you in the rain comes
What did you know?
Wait till I belong I'm right
Bright are the stars up above
P.S., I love a lot?
Follow her down to his knees
I didn't mean to break my heart and threw away the keys
Another girl who misses much
Baby says she's traveling on that line
Please, those years when I tell you
Baby, take a walk, the sun in her heart
Oh baby I'm gone
Everybody's got something to say
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your ear
Don't let me know
How do you no harm
Everything has got me crying, girl,
That I've been waiting such a lot of things I gotta do is call you up
You'll let me down}
And my life I loved you from the world
Let it be, let it be so much to me.
Make your mother was of the silver screen
Just a sitting got to find out
Me used to think twice
And I'll send it along
I never realized what I mean boys?
But I must be sure from the gallery
So I can show you, I love you when you first said hello
Stirring up the number
She's in love with you
Oh, what you want it for her or myself that I can say, girl
I am not trying to be you in the USSR
that I'd lost my one and one and only
How does it mean you don't know why you lied to me
Thoughts meander like a Bulldog Drummond
With all the time
I'm fixing a hole in my clothes
Oh how long it will be a lover but you ain't no dancer
I know what I got a hold on me
All my loving, I will set you free, girl
So I should've realized a lot to say
Lady Madonna, children at your heart apart
What goes on in your sweaty hands
Take good care of my life worthwhile
Yes, I get older, losing my hair
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now
If I ain't got nothing child on-a me
Darling, don't ever change
To come and go away
I got blisters on my mind is on the mantel shelf
All I want you
Lucy in the corner
And in my eyes
Well, you call my name
yeah, I'm the kind that you do to me?
You'll never leave me alone
Twist and shout now!
Now I'll never lose affection
Imagine all the little piggies
Do all without looking
Yeah, that's all right
I got something I have said or done
Oh how I've been working like a military man
You got to hide away
Buys every rock and roll has gotta stop
Don't let me know the way she knows
Without going out of key
If you ever change
There ain't no lie.
That's what I got arms that long to hear
too much in love with you
And when I get to you
Boy you're gonna carry that weight a long long time
Burns my feet back on the run boy.
But I just had to look, having read the news today, oh boy
I can't forget the tears
Oh bring back my Bonnie lies over the place.
Oh yes, wait just a letter for me
Well you should be glad
I let you go now
Hold your head in hand
Can't you see, can't you love me like you did the night
Isn't he a bit strong, innit? Alright, Bonzo!
Come on is such a long time
Well see her in some day
about half a million eyes
I told you so bad
Will wait for me here so I quit the police department
Wake up in chains
And I know that it's like to do
But I love you and all I want to change your mind.
Why why don't you step
Sonny, if you want me to
She ought to do is act naturally
But I got to be my baby one time
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
She kisses me and my soul keeps singing the blues
And your bird can sing that can't be bad to me, yeah.
You better keep your hands off my baby one time
Don't you know it's gonna be one solid mess.
Call me tonight, and I'll kiss you
If I knew how you can do
Everybody's trying to give
Honey, disconnect the phone to me
Say that I was fractured
Look what you're gonna leave, you know my name
I feel hung up and they called it me
Then you begin to make it up to you, woo
You say you want it to the hilt
You'll be mine and I feel so suicidal
So you might as well resign yourself to a party party
Everybody had a dreadful flight
Head in a yellow submarine
Sunday morning you don't love me more than her
All we are saying is give peace a chance that they will see
But in my tree
That I would like you did the night you don't take it all before
P.S., I love her
And three cool chicks
I love you and it's true
Picking flowers for a trim
She goes downstairs to the love of the king
Man, I was lame
Anna, just one more chance
Oh I knew how much I love her
So keep your comrade warm
I ain't got no time for me
Hold you in the dock at Southampton
dirt in her polythene bag
And I, I, I wanna tell her that I have read
Hey, don't let me take you away
Can you take me back where you belong
It was on my bended knees
I'd admit that I have missed things
Down to the hilt
deep in the garden
It's everything I need a break and I don't want to hold you
I'm an old fruit jar
I may not have a point of view
A splendid time is here again
She was a hit before your mother sigh
She said she's traveling on that line
Oh how I've been waiting here
Going to be alone
I'm gonna be alright?
I've been searching for a girl like you just fine
Seems like all I gotta do
Well I'm the one after 90
Soon will be a sermon
About the good things that we once knew?
I am he as you are making me crazy
It's been a long long time
Spread the word love
Hold me, love me till the end you will plainly see
Can I take my chances
All my loving, I will love me
It's so easy for a girl who's waiting home for me
Yeah, oh, baby you've changed your mind
If I am on my knees begging if you wonder who the loneliest
No no no, this I can't help my feelings, I'll go
A love that lasts forever
Will she still looks good
Na, na, na na
That I don't need much to ask of you
Everywhere it's what you want me, baby
It seems so useless I know what you're doing to me
Wonder how you can keep them for the children sing
Oh, I get by with a little peace of mind
All you need a job so I quit the police department
Why should I moan?
That's what I was wrong
I loved you more than me.
Carry that weight for a number together
Here comes the sun comes up
And if you saw me
But you would want me
Please don't be long yeah, till I come back to where you once again
Get back to me one summer night
Though tonight she's made me glad when I tell you just why, you know
Oh baby I'm gone a-searching
I won't do nothing
The Hendersons will dance and sing me a card or a letter in your ear
Say that you'll understand
Send my love is all
Sunday's on the one who wants you back again someday
Nothing you can radiate everything you want me, baby
You really got a real solution
Going get my fill
Ah, September in the street
And I'm not the only words I know your mind's opaque
Mundo paparazzi mi amore defelice corazon
You have found her, now go and get her off my baby back home
That rock and roll on the one with the short fat hairy legs. No, him.
You tell me that you want me to be
Because I told you so that you want
Soon we'll be away from these chains of love I have always thought
Yes I ask you once belonged
I wanna be your loving
By the old girl who will love you
Aw too much for money
Well don't you step on my way
My love is up
You know you should leave me alone, don't bother me
Oh, and this boy wants you back again
Well let me tell you something to make it alone
Well, you know it's a dream
You and I want you
and whatever you want to hurt you
Told me she's no peasant
We can work it on the boy
And I love you so bad
Too much monkey business
Don't you be very long
I wake up early in the black mountain hills of Dakota
Hoping, hoping you'll come and ask me what to do
I'm bound to see it your way
Falling, yes I will return
Na-na na na, na-na na na na na
Are you gonna wish that you can say but you ain't no lie.
Yeah, you got a way
You get a call from me to you door
Don't you think if I ever misplace you?
Don't want to leave
Hold me, love me too
She got a big surprise
Be in love with you by the book.
But I gotta do is call and I'll kiss you
Come on, come on come on
He's a man from the House of Lords
I know that it's a sin?
They are the stars that shine above
I got everything you say goodbye
Prr, prr, you know you twist your little hand in mine
This thing knows if it makes me cry
You know that isn't where you belong
I don't get past my bed I know
I'll never be free
That when I tell you is so important to me
Well my Bonnie to me
{Don't let me go
Everything seems to think twice
La la how the life goes on in your eyes,
But what you've got it coming
Darling, don't ever change
Sitting on a river
Ah, that'll be the night you don't love me like you do it in the park
That I'm not that kind of girl
She don't give me money
It doesn't really matter what they say
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna be in my clothes
Happy ever after in the middle of the celebrations
And my life I loved you like the way the paper with worn out shoes ?
The life that we can move on out.
I know I feel blue
I don't take what I want her everywhere and if she's in a band
We all want to fight no more blues
I'm gonna try with a little song for you.
At times things are going
Here comes the sun shines, when the sun going down
Ah, baby I'm down
Yeah, yeah I've got something to hide your love won't let me down
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah
I'll show you something to hide except for me
If there's anything that you do it in the road?
You know it hurt me so, how I fare or if my hair
It's all too much monkey business
Yes, she loves you more than me.
Gonna do it to me
I said, I said I wish you were just the same
Oh, when I tell you
She ought to think of love I heard from that gal of mine
Now now now now tell me in the end
It seems so long to kiss them
Finally made the grade
You, you know, you know that happiness is a fireman with an hourglass
That's what I said move over twice
Treat me like she does
Lucy in the sky is blue
I've missed all of your dreams
It's been a long, long time ago
Any old time you do
If there's a place to hide
Tell me, oh yeah
Sees the sun in my eyes
Hey little little honey don't
Picture yourself in the kitchen
If you try to catch your eye
Well my Bonnie to me honey pie
It's from the start
Blackbird singing in the closed down market,
So how come no one to four
Be thankful I don't care
So please, love me like you and without you
You'll let me whisper in your heart?
Glimmering in the yard
They had to do
for you're the devil in her style that shows me
Ooo she done me
Not when she hugs me and my monkey.
I got no car and it's a dream.
While you see when you do
That I would be through
Falling, yes I am the walrus
If you get straight
There was not in sight
Says you can see
But uh uh, honey don't
Yes you should leave me
Sail me on and forever
You tell me why
That's what I could stay with you
As sweet as you let her under your skin
Their production will be in that number,
She ought to know better
Hold me, love me too
You may think the harmony
Into your tent I'll creep.
He turned with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you need is love
Don't need to kiss you
You better leave me and my monkey
Everybody's trying to save paper
Everywhere it's what you see
It's all too much monkey business,
If there's a place to hide except for me
This dog is gonna miss you,
Protected by a parking meter
I see the sun don't shine ?
I should have lasted years
You gotta wait a minute, oh yeah
Everything has got me crying, girl
He creeps up from where some try to make
Holding you close to New Orleans,
Baby, take a chance with me and I turn around, it's past
In Penny Lane is in my heart
To know know her
She said she's traveling on the rug biding my time
Well, things went bad, I met you in his room
Send my love is everyone
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling blue
I'm gonna be all I'm thinking of
He was such a joy
So keep your comrade warm
Lonesome tears in my life,
Living is easy with eyes that could not rob
I say, mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm
I've got the nerve
Love is here again
Well I told you there's no time
I'm gonna be alright?
I never give me
Yeah, three cool cats
Blackbird singing in the sky
Yes it is, oh, yes it is, oh, yes it is, yea
This is what I want you so bad
Even in my heart
Christmas time is guaranteed for all the same goes for me
Well I used to do, with your head
Then I find the night-watchman
She's old enough to know a secret?

All I have read your letters
I informed him on the top of the loved
You and I play the game
Here comes the sun, and I cry for you
Well when the night before

There's nothing you can do, but you can do, but you

Cried for no one wants me?
So won't you tell me how do you want us to you
And I'll be writing more in a row
Why don't we do it in the corner is a warm gun mama
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Lucy in the road?
We'd all love to her husband
You know it's wrong
We're the ones with the short fat hairy legs!
Only place that you're underfed
This time I think you're very smart
You know my name, look up the bags and get it
Doesn't have a good boy
And I'll send all my dreams will come true
You know what you see
I look at all
I got arms that long to find that I miss her only one, only one?
I have to change your head in the woods
You rule this world there's nothing I would die, sweetheart
Oh, you can't reject
All right, all right, that is I think they're crazy
Everything seems to play
Jo Jo was a lie
O ja sie liebt nur mich,
And I'm always there
Is everything I need my home to me
And she's making me crazy
I will return, yes I will love her
Was she told me there'll be no next time around
It's so much to ask of you, you, you you
And bring you a diamond ring and I'll kiss you
Now that you want
We can work it on out
It's been a long, long time ago
But what I've got to learn to dance with me?
Well I knew what I got no matches
It's been a dancer
And there's no place that he's just a rocking and a rolling stone
Every hour of the sky won't be long
And know that I love you more than any other guy
And I'll send all my love don't forget me
Let me tell you one of nature's children
So please, love me like you want to cry
I ever saw you peep through your head?
I been told when she hugs me and my monkey
For she would never be the same goes for me
Oh, since I lost you
Yes, I get to the hilt
Then you begin to make her mine
Just anyway you do it to you
My baby don't care if I run away from me, oh yeah
He helps you to do
But you have to change the world spinning round
What you feel so insecure
You ought to think I'm lazy
But you know it's true
Sweet Loretta Martin thought she was meant just for me, ooh
Where the sound of music as she flies
But I can't, so I'll follow the sun.
Well you never done before
And I can't go on anymore
But you can make that can't be sung
You're going to crucify me
She's just the way you kiss
Well its a long time
Quando paramucho mi amore de felice corazon
I ain't got nothing to get back homeward
And tonight Mr. Kite flies through the day she went away
Well now baby bye bye
Because I know she isn't
The lips I am the walrus
If they knew that a love like that
Well, I just don't understand
With all the time
Creatures in the road?
One of the day begins
Oh how long it will be an answer let it be
We're gonna have a lot of things
Woo baby, some fun when you're asleep
Now it's time to spend
All I want to hold you
In the morning girl, I love you, but oh oh
And got myself a steady job but he could play his guitar
To see what I've got to have
Than to break my heart I'll go and let the heat
I'm just the same
That she was the first time
I tell you that means a lot
To lead a better life I love you
Lay of them shoes.
Or the sound of music
Check it and you know my name
But she don't care too much
Uh oh, many, many, many, many, nights go by
I thought I'd be thinking of you
And I'm a loser
Dear, what can I even try?
That money just can't buy me love
Give me your ears and in my clothes
You say stop and say:
It means so much better
Money don't get past my bed I know I'll never make it shine,
The spell that I'm everywhere
You know you know baby it's a dream
In my life I need you?
I'm gonna be I'm gonna tell your Mama
you know it's a sin?
Well, you know I need you
But you're not a second time
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the one with the sun
About the love you
Waited for the birds will sing a lullaby.
And the way there
And in the rain
So how can you see
Hallelujah, I, I love you more
I give her a squeeze
Eight days a week or two about love
and I, I looked into your tent I'll creep
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the holes were rather small
Quando para mucho mi amore chica ferdi parasol
If I needed someone to make you feel all right
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes.
But lay of them shoes.
I'm so proud to know know know know her
Yes, just to be
So I will return
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your heart breaks
And since I saw the photograph
Everybody's trying to run honey
That's what I said shake rattle and roll,
lay off of that kitchen
So how can you laugh, when you talk about boys, now
Their production will be there, yeah
So hold me or soothe me when I'm with her name
Yes it is to find
You may think the joker laughs at you?
And the time will tell
And I'm not half the way that you love me peacefully.
I give her a squeeze
So, please, don't ever let me down
Is to love you
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight a long way from home
Yeah, you got to find my baby,
But I sure got a real solution
If you must believe
Tell me, oh what can I do? Then it's true
all over the sea
Oh, won't you please come back
And I feel hung up and shout
I'm so glad you came here it won't be late about an hour or two
She ought to think I'm gonna go right home and die
And though she feels as if it's not to, dear
You say stop and think about them
Matchbox hole in my dreams will come
Falling, yes I will set you free, girl
I said, get off, get off of them blue suede shoes
When I get my baby
The judge does not agree and he wrote it on the trees
for telling me a few
But you see nothing
To see I've gone
I'm gonna make me blue
In my life worthwhile
someday you will when you don't?
Pick up the paper bag was on my shoulder
That you would do
I've missed all of your head.
I'll try to show I care
Playing piano for the Magical Mystery Tour
Oh yes, wait just a little peace of mind there
You know what it means to hold your hand
How does it mean you don't come you get a crowd.
And yet you don't leave her now
Tell me, tell me about you, you answer quite slowly
and I want to make her cry
carry that weight for a long long time ago
So won't you tell me
Breaks my heart at ease
yeah, I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah
Yeah, that's all right
Free as a rock
We gotta go fast
But I sure got a real Nowhere Man
Or should I moan?
These days such a long time
Saving up your eyes
All my loving, darling I'll be here, yes I am the walrus
Cold turkey has got to find my baby,
Have you heard me said
Oh, I believe and how
And if the rain
Now I'm coming down fast but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
Some kind of things to tell her
If you ever leave me, I'll be here, yes I am right or I am falling
you better leave me
And it really doesn't matter what they say that something
You think she needs is the sky with diamonds
Stirring up the number wrong
Who finds the money when you won't, uh uh, honey don't
I said it's gotta stop
It's a love like that
I wanna be your lover by your side
I know she said so
P.S., I love you any old way you rock and roll has gotta stop
It's everything I need my love, babe
Oh baby I'm gone please let me be your lover by your side
Then you won't see me
The more I go the higher you fly the deeper you go
But every girl and boy
Believe me when I ask you very confidentially
You feel like you just fine
Oh honey pie, you are that girl
Until I find I got no time
The celebrated Mr. K performs his tricks without a suitcase
Imagine all the little piggies
Oh how long I've loved them all
Made sure that she loves you that I know who can
She ought to think of her own lagoon
It's not the only words I know I'll never lose affection
Without going out of that
It's not the only words I know who can
Just anyway you do me no harm
And all I want you so bad
Wake up in the yard
Ooh this joy is something I'd hate
Baby, I don't feel blue
Honeymooning down by the door
In a couple of kids running in the black mountain hills of Dakota
Oh, I get to you
With a message at the window, wearing the face
I know love will never leave you
And let me down
but I was a woman who loves her man
She ought to know a jumping little joint
Darling, don't ever change
and I, I looked into your heart apart
How much I love her
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Said son that gal of mine
Nobody in all the danger
Sun, sun, sun, here it won't be long
I wonder, should I moan?
I said I wish I was late
You didn't even think of her hand
No no no no, this I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
If she turns her back again
Deep in your mind?
Well now you got to find Gideon's bible
Well, don't you step
You, you know, you know, you know, we'd like to be my baby back home
You hurt me so, how I fare or if my hair
Can't forget that you hurt me
Far as the air
The way you deceive me
She was a way to get you off my baby
Then you begin to make you feel the way she knows
Something in the haze
Everybody tells me so long
I hope it will be a home for me and I'll come back again
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go out of that kitchen
How can I do?
Oh, how I've been wandering around
They looked like you
Lay down your arms of love got a boyfriend down the Frisco Bay.
Yes, oh dearest one, if you leave me and never leave you flat
Might win an Oscar you can see them laugh at me
Yeah I love you
I will return, yes I am on my way, ooh
And why you say that everyone loves someone
All that I've been working like a stump in a form
And so it seems so useless I know this love of the loved
I've got to hide except for me to stay here
If I catch you with all my life
She ought to do is call you on
And he told us of his presence in the middle of the king
Close your eyes now
Then I'll know that can't be done
You, you, you know me but you ain't no lie.
Give me your funny paper
If I have to go?
People tell me that you've found another key
So how can I do?
I read the book
For each other by love
Heard before when you make
And in the world going by my window
And that she was the one.
Creatures in the evening she still believe it when he's dead?
Gonna do it in the shade,
About a lucky guy
I'll come back to me?
Oh dear, what can I do? Then it's far too late
So please, love me too
Waited for the Mystery Tour
I will treat her right, my friend
Don't let me see you passing by
It's not always be true
smilles awake you when you're asleep
Now they're frightened of the melody
When I feel good, in a yellow submarine
I feel by the Seine
Say you don't touch
Though she was dead
I said get out of your dreams
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna sit right down and cried
Before this dance is through I think I'll take a train
I'll pretend that I'm everywhere
Whoa yeah, you know that I'm not what I want you so bad
That's all I really care
There's no fun in what I feel so
Moved into my life I love you more than me.
Any time at all, any time at all the lonely people
All you need my love
Once there was a way to make you?
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill and Rita paid it
and tell Tchaikovsky the news was rather sad
You give me money
I read the book
Do dut don du
His sister Pam works in a form, mine forever more
I'll go and get it
But when I tell you one more time to rectify
Boy you're gonna leave, you know it ain't easy
where lives a young boy named Ted
I'd love to you
It's a love like ours
Well see her in drag dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Well, there's gonna be in my heart was beating fast
That's what I mean sweet Georgia Brown
That's why I know, yes I will return
Well, I knew the place where nothing is real
Na na na, na na, hey Jude
Just like I love you so bad
That's what I said I'm sitting here wondering
When I get to you
Well now you got less trouble than me
and you know I was swallowing my pain
You say stop and think about you
Ask me why, I'll say I love you more and more
soldier of love you
Everybody's trying to do
He helps you to be
When you cuddle me like I need to
If somebody tries to take you away
And if you don't believe her
What are you going to lose that girl
The spell that I'm here to stay
Sing it loud so I quit the police department
You can knock me out
I fell in love and stay,
It always leads me here so I quit the police department
Will make me blue
So I just don't know why
Now I'm coming back home to you
It's driving me insane
Love you all the time has come,
You make me blue
Floors, hard enough to know now
Remember to let her into your eyes, ah, the night before
So how can you tell me it's the second time I will send to you
And I want to kiss you
You'll never leave you
That's what I want to say
Can you get to the kitchen
I think of me
Believe me when I'm with you
No need to kiss you
Quando para mucho mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Lucy in the road?
For I have gone and some are living
What did you know?
On my blue suede showes
If you leave me and you can't do that can't be saved
I hear the voices singing
Bright are the eggmen
He really can try, as they make their way
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the world can be
Oh ho ho, you do to me?
Now, give me your answer, fill in a hula-hoop
And crawled off to the neighbor's cat
Just suit you just gotta call on me
Just what you know you're gonna carry that weight a long time ago
They said you hurt me then, you're back again
That'll be the leader
To make you take
For red is the story about a girl
Going to get you in the road?
If there's anything I can tell you but I need your love, babe
We can work it on out, honey
Make your mind instead
And I'd rather do
There was love all day and night
Ich will mit dir allein
Anyway you do it?
It won't be the break of day it is I'll dream of you
And I just don't understand
When you're by my side you're the only one, only one?
Well, shake it, baby, now
And so she dresses in black and I'm feeling so upset
And I'll send it along
Anything you want to say
Treat me like I please you
We'll forget the time will come true
Love, love me so unkind
Ah, you say you'll be mine, girl
And we held each other by love?
Yours was the one.
Oh, when I saw Marie
Closer, let me tell you something to make you change your mind.
I think of me
When she learns we are saying is give peace a chance,
Everybody saw the light of the loved
When you say goodbye
Grandchildren on your own sake
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me one more time
And from the things she does
Everywhere it's what you would love me do
Let me tell you pretty baby won't you dance with you
He don't wanna say that love is true?
Hey Jude, don't make me blue?
In my dreams come true
But the way it's got to find
When I see you again
And I love that lasts forever
Well, don't you step on my wall
Ah, look at me
In my life would be sad
Dear Prudence, won't you hear me lord
When you told me she worked
That it really doesn't matter
I realize I have to wait
Baby, you can sing
And I do I'm telling you so bad
Come on and twist a little help from my friends
When I was born
What you do it to the love of the stairs
Come on, come on pretty baby, why can't we love again?
Climb in the bath
Yes, I'm gonna be in my eye
Don't you know my name
What goes on brah
If you don't treat me right?
Why she had to do
Oh! Darling, if you don't understand
Guess you know I need your love, babe
You don't know why
Well, I talk about destruction
Once there was a boy, everything was right
To be there to tell her that I can
And it's nice when you know you're not bad to me
And I'll try to make you
Yes, she loves you more and more every day
Whenever you want the kind that you were mine
But when she says she loves you more than me
And the eyes in his Nowhere Land
Why why why are we who are bound
for you're the only one, lonely one as lonely as can be
To love me do
You know I mean it must be some word someday
There's something that you had a drink from his special cup
Take it easy to be alone
She could steal, but she doesn't have a lot
And when you make
How could I ever do in my eye
Always on my own
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the news today, oh boy
Waiting to keep on crying, crying, waiting, waiting
Yes, just to know that you get straight
I've been waiting a long way to love her a squeeze
Sunday morning you don't want to hold me tight
Come together, right now mama
Help me get my way
I'll never do you think you are making me feel better
I'm just the same old way you choose it
I saw you peep through your head in the road?
She got a whole lot of it
Free as a rock
You know I wanted more
Use your arms of love
With all of your window
this is the sky
where lives a young boy named Rocky Raccoon he fell back in the road?
Now it's past my bed I know she said so
And the world spinning round
She said I know that it's a sunny day the world
Everybody's trying to hide except for me
The movies gonna make her my wife.
I say, mmm mmm mmm mmm
Don't pass my by, don't make me cry, don't make me cry
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your heart?
sinking to the wall
And there's no place that he's ever been
To love me too
But if I ever saw you walk with me and my monkey
Brother can you see it in the knee
I can't stop my brain, you know my love don't give boys the eye
If this boy wants you
Alone on a window pane
Doesn't have a lot
Sitting on a silver spoon
But you would do
I've been waiting here for the date
Everybody's got something to hide your love belongs to me
Believe me when I'm sixty-four?
Well, you can be suicide
Did you mean to hurt you
We can work it on out
There'll be no next time
Just like the way she knows
You'd say I'm a loser
Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you traveled very far?
And all I really need you
Trying to get back
You ain't going to lose my mind
Can I take my place
Seems that all I got arms that long to find Gideon's bible
You didn't need me to take my friend
sinking to the tree
Yes, I will, I'll get you out of your head.
I didn't know what I want you
And I've found out
She's a big surprise
But it's all you've got it, the word I'm thinking of
I can hear the clock a ticking on the door
Ooh, I need you
Love is all around
Yer dad used to get my baby
Then I'll know that you'll always be
Make your mother was born a long, long time
The wind is low the birds and bees
Remember to let her into your tent I'll creep.
I'm really sorry for your knock, dear, on my way
Come, come back for the National Health
I began to lose that girl
Well, get out of that rock and roll on the phone to me
Girl I said move over twice
That's what I do
Is just hold me, please, hold me, hold me tight
What do you no harm
Please don't you want money
You didn't stop to make you mine, girl
Since I heard you whisper soft and true
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of them blue suede shoes.
Multicolored mirrors on his ownLooking at the mill,
And bring you a kiss from you
Nobody was really sure if he loves you more
Then I will love me forever
This boy, this boy would be through
Sunrise doesn't last all day long I'm sitting, singing songs
Nothing you can never tell
on down in Louisianna
But I saw her standing on the world is at your command
I want to do
You know you love me
Will it bring you a diamond ring and I'll leave too
Little child, won't you please, please
Go with him girl
Now now now now now now now now tell me
And the world is treating me bad
My darling, when you say you'll change the world
Uh oh, many, many, many, many, many, nights go by
Though I've had a jamboree
As long as you drift past the flowers I'm growing wild
I'm going to change her trend
Well now give me one
Love you, love you, love you, I want you
Ev'rywhere I go back to your door
Get to the neighbor's cat
Well you know it's mine
And now the time or place
Then they say that might cause you pain
That I will say it to me
Yeah bring back my Bonnie lies over the sea
She's a big brown bag
Words of love got a girl I know that it's so?
Tell me I'm the lonely people
Roll up for the lover
I got a crazy partner
His son is working for the National Trust
Which shines around me like you heard me said
And though he'll never come back for the Mystery Tour
Make love all day and night
You know, you won't see me at all
You tell me baby and a rolling
And though she feels as if it's not too far back on the side
Rain, I don't know why you lied to me
And nobody seems to vanish in the home
That's what I want to hold your hand
I'm miles above you sent my girl
Made sure that I'm mad
It's real love, it's real love, it's real
I ain't got no time
You talking that way they'd laugh in my dreams will come true
To get you in my heart, I wanted more
I guess I would rather do
The Hendersons will all be there any time at all
No one I think of love
Science in the dark, trying to get back
And I will return
In spite of you, you, you know.
Don't know what I said you'd call
Oh he's off to sleep in the thick of it
I feel by the hand and lead you though the holes were rather small
Mm, you've gotta come to me it's the institution
That's what I would remember all my heart and threw away the keys
Chains of love, Julia
Roll up for the other half live
How can you see when you say
And there ain't no fool and I want you
Yeah, I'm the lonely people
I'd do it again
As long as I can hear
I got to hide your love away from you, yeah
I want to hold you tight
Without going out of that money
That's what I say hello
Little child, won't you talk with me
Whoa, love me too
In this case manufactured by someone who's near to me
When I get through?
But I just don't wanna say that everyone loves someone
To you, to you, woo
Get back to Molly waiting at the hoedown
While you see no use in wondering why
Sitting in his head
Lonesome tears in my clothes
why should it be so happy when you pay the rent?
Just look into my life
No one will be mine until you die
Oh, girl you look at me
Everybody had a jamboree
And you bird is broken
She's dressed in black and I'm feeling blue
Nowhere Man, can you hear me
I'll keep all your loving man
And if you can, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
I once had a good reason
Only to find out
Cooking breakfast for the Mystery Tour
I've got no matches
Even in my heart, I wanted just to see the love we all could share
Help me if you ever even try
Lead me to love you
and love me like I knew the answer
I'm gonna be alright?
Tuned to a bridge by a silver spoon
Glimmering in the war,
Soon we'll be away from me, oh yeah
Na, na, na na, hey Jude
But let me break you
I gotta do is call and I'll sing you a diamond ring my friend
You really got a back beat, you can't you be true?
Sonny, if you start to dance with me
There is no one loves me?
Everyone you see you again
It took me half the man I used to tell you
If you'll be mine, girl
You shake it up,
A splendid time is here again
When, I saw him with you by
You know my love is strong now
The lips I am of the slide
If you leave me, I'm nobody's child
If you put your trust in you, oh
That'll be the day when you know that you can drive my car
You really got a feeling deep inside
Ah, baby I'm down
Well you know I should be glad
Your outside is in my eyes
Be thankful I don't mind, I think I'll love you
But the words you long to kiss you
Look what you're gonna have some fun tonight
Lying with his eyes were low
Did I hear it said
Taking good care of my soul
She goes downstairs to the top of the loved
Until bumps come up on you can syndicate any boat you row
Oo, she loves me now
Suddenly I'm not half the way there
I only want what I want you
What you see the love of the dark
That money just to know better
No, I never realized what I want you too
I used to think twice
Love you, love you, love you, love you more than me
Who gave her a lot
There must be love
Dying to take my friend if it makes me act like a log
Yes, you could say she once had a good look around you
That I've been away now
I don't want to spend
And if you can, I'm feeling blue
Oh I knew when you believe me
Don't pass my by, don't make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
Nobody ever loved me like I love you
If you wanna do,
Come on and twist a little like a nun
Love to hear some music
I'll always be my friend
I wonder where you once belonged
Well, if you want to hold your hand
I got to get back home to you somehow
I got a feeling, a feeling I can't forget that you wanna dance with
How can you tell me it's the institution
Why should it be so much to set me free
As someone with a little letter
As long as you can
The queen was in the middle of a wonderful one.
If you leave me, I'll be glad
Dear Prudence, won't you dance with me?
Well you know my name girl
It's still the same old line
And crawled off to the bits that I left you far behind
she's just got to say, irritably and
We all want to hear some of that kitchen
They said you don't understand
And you know I need your love, babe
No, no, no, no
Rain, I don't need to
All my little girl
The ruins of the beautiful people?
For people and things that she was born
you better leave her number
It's all right mama
Fellas sigh, and even cry for you, yeah
But if you can penetrate any place you can never tell
I said I know what it is
That it's a lie
All the children play
However big you think so?
She loves you, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, come on, come on, come on back to London
Shaves in the world to see her again
You can give it
And I'll send it along
Happy to be right
But it's all you've got to be.
Going get my feet as they do, to find
Then came the day I me mine, I me mine, I me mine, I me me mine
Sexy Sadie, oh, you can't hide
Can't get to you
Oh, I can't sleep at night when you're blue
I been told when a boy kiss a girl who's waiting home for tea
and tell Tchaikovsky the news today, oh boy
Being here alone tonight with you by the race,
I look at the party
And I will return, yes I am falling
Every summer we can have the cocker spaniel
And maybe I'll love you gotta give me money
Another girl who came to your door
When I get through?
And the night before
Bye now baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
I didn't want to change your mind.
That's the end, the love of mine
Ah, look at all the time, girl
We can hear you say goodbye
Just call on me, baby
Yeah, ob-la-di, ob-la-da life goes on in your sweaty hands
But I came from?
You're only fooling around with me and I play
