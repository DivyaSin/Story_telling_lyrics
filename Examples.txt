#### LYRICS 1 ####

A Child was standing on a street corner
Vouching for the integrity of the visiting foreigner .
He leaned with one shoulder
The family at the boulder

He swayed the other to and fro
About dawn he got up to blow .
He stood dreamily gazing.
Then he heard the outer door closing .

##### STORY 2 #####

Once upon a time, there was a boy very lane
He feared of wars
He took a ride
The weather was sunny
Fishes were in the sea
So clear was the sky
It was a beautiful sight.

Once upon a time, there was a boy very lane
I just wanna feel okay again .
He feared of wars
Hell never fall in love he swears .

He took a ride
Or someone with a softer side .
The weather was sunny
To roll your eyes at , honey .

Fishes were in the sea
I hope you think of me .
So clear was the sky
Than love and lie .

It was a beautiful sight.
The phone rings on a rainy night .

##### STORY 3 #####

There was an old owl that lived in an oak
Everyday he saw incidents happening around him
Yesterday he saw a boy helping an old man
Today he saw a girl shouting at her mother
The more he saw the less he spoke
As he spoke less, he heard more
Some became better and some became worse
But the old owl had become wiser each and every day.

There was an old owl that lived in an oak
Come back , come back , come back to me like .
Everyday he saw incidents happening around him
Heart break is the national anthem .

Yesterday he saw a boy helping an old man
We ' ll be out of here as soon as we can .
Today he saw a girl shouting at her mother

There lived a black sheep in a nearby village
Every spring, he shaved his black wool and sold it
Sweaters and socks are made from vlacl wool
One day, the sheep noticed that he had some more wool left
An old man came over to his wooden shed
He wanted one bag full
Then an old woman came over
She also wanted a bag full of wool
Therefore, the black sheep prepared two bags full of wool for them
He was happy that all of his wool was sold off

##### STORY 5 #####

The rumor had spread fast
Enemy had fallen into the river
Prince saved Enemy's life
Prince was being kissed
Suddenly Enemy recognized Prince's tattoo
It was the same as the one used by the fraternity
The fraternity had murdered Enemy's father some months ago
At once all those terrible memories were present again
For long time Prince and Enemy had been rivals
Now, those feelings seemed to grow more and more
Prince's frame of mind was very volatile
Without thinking, Enemy was charged against
Enemy felt panic
Enemy ran away from Prince to hide in the Popocateptl
Enemy thoroughly observed Prince
Then, Enemy took a dagger
Jumped towards Prince
Prince was attacked.
