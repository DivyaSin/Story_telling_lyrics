Dead leaves and the dirty ground
when I know you're not around
shiny tops and soda pops
when I hear your lips make a sound
Thirty notes in the mailbox
will tell you that I'm coming home
and I think I'm gonna stick around
for a while so you're not alone
If you can hear a piano fall
you can hear me coming down the hall
if I could just hear your pretty voice
I don't think I need to see at all
Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
and every breath that is in your lungs
is a tiny little gift to me
I didn't feel so bad till the sun went down
then I come home
no one to wrap my arms around
Well any man with a microphone
can tell you what he loves the most
and you know why you love at all
if you're thinking of the holy ghost
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just Postmix lemonade
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
Baby, I was made to break your heart
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you
With you this girl is only gonna break your heart
What a wicked game you played to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
And I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
This girl is only gonna break your heart
Nobody loves no one
I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self same face
The wouldn't let me sleep
And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you dear
Everything has changed
My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore dear
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
So lift off love
So lift off love
And we took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
So lift off love
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Once I walked a lonely road
I had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
Lonely days of uncertainty
They disappear when you're near me
When you're around my life's worthwhile
And now I long to see you smile
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
My life is right
My life is right
My life is right
Once I walked a lonely road
I had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
My life is right
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
I noticed you
You stood out like a sore thumb
The most
Beautiful sore thumb I'd ever seen
I took you out
And showed you a good time
We danced all night
And I waited till the time was right when
I was almost sick on you
Echo echo of mine
Do you recall
The night that we first met
And how I burnt your dress
With my cigarette
I don't know why
But I played this game
For you
I'm guessing it's just what all young lovers do
You say
That it's never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Echo echo of mine
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
So echo on
Echo on
Echo on
Echo
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain, you said
And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second
I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain, you said
And it's all running out like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
It's just the way I smile, you said
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And is it happens
It happens here in this house
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And there's someone
Calling on the telephone
Let's stay home
It's cold outside
And I have so much
To confide to you
With or without words
I'll confide everything
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here in this house
So we stay at home
And I'm by your side
And you know
What's going on inside
Inside my heart
Inside this house
And I just want to
Let it out for you
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
And oh, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
Twenty miles left to the show
Hello, my old country Hello
Stars are just beginning to appear
and I have never, in my life
before been here
And it's my heart, not me
who cannot drive
at which conclusion you arrived,
watching me sit here, bolt upright,
and cry for no good reason
at the Eastering sky
And the tilt of this strange nation,
and the will to remain for the duration
waving the flag
feeling it drag
Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby
like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby
step, ball-change, and a-pirouette
And I regret, I regret
how I said to you
Honey, just open your heart
when Ive got trouble
even opening a honey jar
And that, right there, is where we are
And Ive been fessing, double-fast
addressing questions nobody asked
I'll get this joy off of my chest, at last
and I will love you
till the noise has long since passed 
And I did not mean to shout, Just drive
Just get us out, dead or alive 
The road's too long to mention 
Lord, it's something to see! 
laid down by the
Good Intentions Paving Company,
all the way to the thing
we've been playing at, darling
I can see that you're wearing
your staying-hat, darling
And for the time being, all is well
Won't you love me a spell?
This is blindness, beyond all conceiving,
while behind us, the road is leaving,
and leaving, and falling back
like a rope gone slack
And, I saw straightaway
that the lay was steep,
but I fell for you, honey,
easy as falling asleep
And that, right there,
is the course I keep.
And no amount of talking
is going to soften the fall,
but, like after the rain,
step out of the overhang. That's all.
It had a nice ring to it,
when the old opry house rang,
so, with a solemn auld lang
syne, sealed, delivered,
I sang.
And there is hesitation,
and it always remains
concerning you, me,
and the rest of the gang,
but, in our quiet hour,
I feel I see everything,
and am in love
with the hook
upon which everyone hangs.
And I know you meant
to show the extent
to which you gave a goddang
you ranged real hot and real cold,
but I'm sold,
I am at home on that range.
And I do hate to fold,
right here, at the top of my game,
when Ive been trying
with my whole heart and soul
to stay right here, in the right lane.
But it can make you feel over, and old
Lord, you know it's a shame,
when I only want for you to pull over,
and hold me,
till I can't remember my own name.
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door 
Of an empty room 
And you go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun 
When you spend a day 
Without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
We burst the pretty balloon, took us to the moon 
It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie 
If I said I'd rather die, than live without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing 
And it grooves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part 
And it's breaking my heart 
To have to spend another day without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo
Can't go on without her 
Doo doo, doo doo doo
There's no song without her 
It's all wrong without her 
Can't go on without her
Take me out tonight 
Where there's music and there's people 
And they're young and alive 
Driving in your car 
I never never want to go home 
Because I haven't got one 
Anymore 
Take me out tonight 
Because I want to see people and I 
Want to see life 
Driving in your car 
Oh, please don't drop me home 
Because it's not my home, it's their
Home, and I'm welcome no more 
And if a double-decker bus 
Crashes into us 
To die by your side 
Is such a heavenly way to die 
And if a ten-ton truck 
Kills the both of us 
To die by your side 
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine 
Take me out tonight 
Take me anywhere, I don't care 
I don't care, I don't care 
And in the darkened underpass 
I thought oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I 
Just couldn't ask) 
Take me out tonight 
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care 
I don't care, I don't care 
Driving in your car 
I never never want to go home 
Because I haven't got one, da... 
Oh, I haven't got one 
And if a double-decker bus 
Crashes into us 
To die by your side 
Is such a heavenly way to die 
And if a ten-ton truck 
Kills the both of us 
To die by your side 
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine 
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And I'm pushing on the door
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
There you go
Standing with the look of avarice
Talking to Huddie Ledbetter
Showing pictures on the wall
Whispering in the hall
And pointing a finger at me
There you go, there you go
Standing in the sun darling
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before
There you go
Taking good care of your boy
Seeing that he's got clean clothes
Putting on his little red shoes
I see you know he's got clean clothes
A-putting on his little red shoes
A-pointing a finger at me
And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Looking straight at you
Coming through, darling
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dreams
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me
Would you kiss-a my eyes
Lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again
In another world
In another world
In another time
Got a home on high
Ain't nothing but a stranger in this world
I'm nothing but a stranger in this world
I got a home on high
In another land
So far away
So far away
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
We are going up to heaven
We are going to heaven
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
In another face
Two atoms they collide in all their random ways
The meeting of you and I not so random some might say
She walks up close to me and she looks me in the eyes
She said
Boy, what's it gonna be, now that it's just you and I?
I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
So I stepped up to the plate to a place I thought I'd never be
So I'm thanking you today because of you I am now me
Cold days them dark and blue when we was our only friend
For all that we've been through and will go through again
For that I say
I will come and I will stand
And I will live my life beside you
I'm a proud, a proud man, but all the same I'm
I'm just a fool, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
Two atoms they collide, you and I we make them child
What lovely creatures they are, something right from the stars
And I helped you bring them forth
I offered a safe place to land
An overflow of love, falling right into my hands
For that I say
I will come and I will stand
And I will live my life beside you
I'm a proud, a proud man
A proud man to be walking right next to your shoes
You're the one, the only one, the only one that's just right just for me
But all the same, you know I, you know I'm, I'm just a fool
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace 
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives 
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll sail around the world
I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?
How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
A trail for the devil to erase
San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may
I love you
Ive a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you, my responsibility has found a place beside you
And strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job
Maybe, but not what she deserves
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare
The catcher hits for 318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench
I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like Walk Away, Renee
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour
Meet you at the statue in an hour
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song, oh yeah
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill Ive never known, oh yeah
You smiled, you smiled oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a National guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war
I'm going to Graceland
Graceland
In Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But Ive reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland
She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But Ive reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe Ive a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
I smell smoke that comes from a gun
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
It was a long time ago, could have happened to anyone
He was struck by a bullet and he melted into fluid
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
Extinction
One thousand miles an hour, I'm just like anyone
I want to feel the road of tar beneath the wheel
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
And evolving from the sea would no be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something about a son of a gun
Named extinction
Extinction
Extinction
All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
The light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
Once again
Gone are the days of rainbows
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks
Straight at you
But I'll come a-running
Straight to you
But I'll come a-running
One more time
Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk howling at the moon
The chariots of angels are colliding
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
I love you from the bottom, of my pencil case
I love you in the songs, I write and sing
Love you because, you put me in my rightful place
And I love the PRS cheques, that you bring
Cheap, never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down, down, down, down
Oh Shirley, oh Deborah, oh Julie, oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name, I forget your name
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forget your name
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forget your name
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face
And I love you 'till my fountain pen runs dry
Deep so deep, the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lovey cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
For you, for you
I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Tender is the night
Lying by your side
Tender is the touch
Of someone that you love too much
Tender is the day

Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Ive found a way to make you
Ive found a way
A way to make you smile
I read bad poetry
Into your machine
I save your messages
Just to hear your voice.
You always listen carefully
To awkwards rhymes.
You always say your name.
Like I wouldn't know it's you
At your most beautiful.
Ive found a way to make you
Ive found a way
A way to make you smile
At my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly.
With every one, whisper I love you.
I let you sleep.
I know you're closed eye watching me,
Listening.
I thought I saw a smile.
Ive found a way to make you
Ive found a way
A way to make you smile
So be it, I'm your crowbar
If that's what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess
And I will pretend
That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know
And you can use my skin
To bury your secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion 
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time all the time
I'll know I'll know
Baby-I can't help you out,
While she's still around
For the time being, 
I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense
All the time give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtains,
I'll wait by the backstage door
While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for a encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It's ok, don't need to say it
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire,
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues
Let the camera linger on your perfect skin
Your widows peak and your lucky grin
And the bluest eyes I know
As you turn to go
Let there be a record of your gorgeous voice
The turn of phrase that filled my days with joy
Something like Bing singing soft and low
As you turn to go
I know I'm not supposed to say, I'm sorry
I know you've had more loves than Mata Hari
But you know you're the star of my life story
And I'm so sorry
Let the poets struggle to describe your heart
Your art of love and your love of art
Well, if you ever loved me, tell me so
As you turn to go

If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?
I never know what the future brings,
But I know you are here with me now,
We'll make it through,
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I don't want to run away but I can't take it, I don't understand,
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed?
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head?
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life?
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?
I don't know why you're so far away,
But I know that this much is true,
We'll make it through,
And I hope you are the one I share my life with,
And I wish that you could be the one I die with,
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with,
I hope I love you all my life
I don't want to run away but I can't take it , I don't understand,
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?
Cause I miss you body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away,
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today,
Cause I love you, whether it's wrong or right,
And though I can't be with you tonight,
You know my heart is by your side
I don't want to run away but I can't take it,
I don't understand,
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?
Is there any way I can stay in your arms?

Eva, eva, eva (uh)

Always looking over my shoulder
'Cause I don't ever wanna miss you

Life is tough if you fall
You've got it all and you're not satisfied
People try to lead you astray
But I ain't gonna fall for the games that they play
I know of the dangers of fooling with strangers

You, you are my one temptation
You, you are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah, honey, it's you
You are my one temptation
You give me the thrill that I'm addicted to
Ah, you're my one temptation

You can look, you can't touch
Nothing is free if you pay too much,
When there's talk on the street and the pressure is hot
You want more than you got
Don't hear what they're saying, day out and day in

You, you are my one temptation
Ooh, you are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah, nobody knows you are my one temptation
Ooh, give me the thrill that I'm addicted to
You're my one temptation, oh

Nothin' ever happens 'til you show your face around
Can't let you see that you've turned my world around
A love that's gone and yet too strong to say no
The only one who could lead me on
You're the one, you're the only one

You, you are my one temptation, ooh
You are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah, honey, it's you
You, you are my one temptation
You give me the thrill, oh, baby

You, you are my one temptation, ooh
You are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah, honey, it's you
You, you are my one temptation
You give me the thrill, oh, baby

Don't know why 
I'm survivin' every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end
And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears, so far, are a waste of time
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do

If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-huh, oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-hoh

Oh da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Oooh, oooh
Aahhhh! Aahhhh!

Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-huh, oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-hoh
Oh!
Aahhhh! Aahhhh!
Oh!
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-huh, oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-hoh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-huh, oh
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody, baby
If I can't have you uh-hoh

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Oh, Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday, Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday, Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love

Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate

Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday
I'm in love

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love

Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday, Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love

People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you, need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer, it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
If you, if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining every day
For me
I swore I would be true
And fellow, so did you
So why were you holding her hand?
Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do have to let it linger?

Oh, I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong, I was wrong
If you, if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you
And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do have to let it linger?

And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do have to let it linger?

You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do have to let it linger?
Do you have to, do you have to, do have to let it linger?

I feel it in my fingers
I feel it in my toes
The love that's all around me
And so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show
You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
Cause on my love you can depend
I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I cannot get to thinking
Of all the things you said
You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do
You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning, there'll be no end
Cause on my love you can depend
I got to keep it moving
It's written in the wind
Oh everywhere I go
So if you really love me, love me
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it
Come on and let it,
Come on and let it show
Come on and let it,
Come on and let it,
Come on and let it show,
Come on and let it show,
Come on and let it show

Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears

I told you
That we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart

I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

You were standing

Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart

I

You were there
Two worlds collided

I was running late for work
So I didn't change my shirt
The evening's drinks left a lingering taste in my mouth
And when I left you were fast asleep
Tangled in the sheets
And on the bus I could have sworn 
It was all a dream
And it didn't happen to me
And then I felt the scrapes
From the slippery subway grate
Oh, how you laughed
At my complete lack of grace
But I could not recall
A more perfect fall
'Cause when I looked up into your eyes
It didn't hurt at all
And I thought, be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here 
With me in the morning
And I thought, be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here 
With me in the morning
Be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here 
With me in the morning

Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy,

My opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact.
No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.

No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.

He may not be a movie star, but when it comes to bein' happy we are.

Sometimes I feel so happy
Sometimes I feel so sad
Sometimes I feel so happy
But mostly you just make me mad
Baby, you just make me mad
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Thought of you as my mountain top
Thought of you as my peak
A thought of you as everything
Ive had, but couldn't keep
Ive had, but couldn't keep
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Skip a life completely
Stuff it in a cup
They said, money is like us in time
It lies, but can't stand up
Down for you is up
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
It was good what we did yesterday
And I'd do it once again
The fact that you are married
Only proves you're my best friend
But it's truly, truly a sin
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
If I could make the world as pure
And strange as what I see
I'd put you in a mirror
I'd put in front of me
I'd put in front of me
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

You went and saved the best for last

I'm not a perfect person
There's many thing I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

Ive found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear

Ive found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you (x4)

I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know

Ive found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you

Ive found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you

Ive never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
Ive never seen you shine so bright
Ive never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance, given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind

The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

Ive never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
Ive never seen you shine so bright, you were amazing
Ive never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled, it took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love, as I do tonight

The lady in red is dancing with me, cheek to cheek
There's nobody here, it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight

I never will forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red, the lady in red
The lady in red, my lady in red

I love you

Kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me 
Thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me 
Don't care even if I blow my top 
But, honey (ah hmm) honey, don't stop 
I'd like to play a little game with you 
A little game especially made for two 
If you come close then I will show you how 
Closer, closer, now 

Kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me 
Thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me 
Don't care even if I blow my top 
But, honey (ah hmm) honey, don't stop 

We've never played this little game before 
If you relax then you'll enjoy it more 
Just settle down and let me teach you how 
Closer, closer, now 

Kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me 
Thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me 
Don't care even if I blow my top 
But, honey (ah hmm) honey, don't stop 
(But, honey, honey, don't stop) 

You kiss so well my lips begin to burn 
And I can tell Ive got a lot to learn 
So hold me close and darling show me how 
Closer, closer, now 
Kiss me, honey, honey, kiss me 
Thrill me, honey, honey, thrill me 
Don't care even if I blow my top 
But, honey, honey, don't stop 
But, honey, honey, don't stop 
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
and there you were
With sweet love and devotion
deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore,
everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better to me than Ive been to myself
For me, there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
She was born in November 1963
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed
That every man could be free
So her mama got high, high, high
And her daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs
And he pictured all the places
That he knew that she belonged
But he failed and taught her young
The only thing she's need to carry on
He taught her how to
Run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run
Past the arms of the familiar
And their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
so long
Baby loves to run
She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting
Through the pouring rain
She's searching through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she's pictures all the places
Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how
To carry on
So run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run
From the old familiar faces and
Their old familiar ways
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
So long
Baby loves to run
Making my way down town
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder If you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in
Your precious memory
'Cause I need you
And I miss you and now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by, oh
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I, I don't want to let you know I
I drown in your memory I
I don't want to let this go
I, I don't
Making my way down town walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time, would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you, now
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you, tonight
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'd hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
My world was shattered I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darling then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind
And darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do, oh
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time, whoa baby
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
Then maybe, maybe, maybe
You'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
You drink your coffee 
I sip my tea 
And we're sitting here, playing so cool
Thinking, 'What will be, will be' 
And it's getting kind of late now 
Oh, I wonder if you'll stay now 
Stay now, stay now, stay now 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'? 
I move a little closer to you
Not knowing quite what to do and I'm 
Feeling all fingers and thumbs 
I spill my tea, oh silly me
It's getting kind of late now 
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'? 
And then we touch, much too much
This moment has been waiting for a long, long time
Makes me shiver
Makes me quiver
This moment I am so unsure
This moment I have waited for
Well is it something you've been waiting for
Waiting for too? 
Take off your eyes 
Bare your soul
Gather me to you and make me whole 
Tell me your secrets 
Sing me the song
Sing it to me in the silent tongue 
It's getting kind of late now 
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now, stay now, stay now
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'
Come with me, my love
To the sea, the sea of love
I wanna tell you just how much I love you
Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you
Come with me to the sea of love
Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you, oh, how much I love you
Come with me to the sea, the sea of love
Your lies won't leave me alone
You used to say you loved me did ya
Why'd you do me this way
It didn't have to be that way
I got your message on the phone
I hung on every single line
You told me what we had was only business
Hurt me so bad I had to sit down with the sickness
Oh yeah
Your lies won't leave me alone
Tore the phone out the wall and it's still ringin'
Wreck the room and curtains ain't hangin' baby
Guitar ain't playin'
Your lies won't leave me alone
Look at your picture in the room I can see you were
Never happy with me baby
All my uncertainty is easy to see
How you're killin' me, cause
I got those bills you would not pay
The cost of our love is way too high and I just keep on
Payin' baby
Why'd you say you loved me - walk around and carry on
Hurting 'bout your love is gone, the song I sing is sad
And long, wonder if you are alone
I don't know if I belong
Your lies won't leave me - alone
Loneliness is the coat you wear
A deep shade of blue is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Baby
Emptiness is the place you're in
Nothing to lose, but no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Lonely
Without you
Baby
Oh, I need you
I can't go on
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Not anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Bring it back, baby
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Oh, baby
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things, get more comfortable
Everything is going right
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown, oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah, I know we're cool
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
See-cool, I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Now that Ive lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby, I'm grieving
But if you want to leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl
You know Ive seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
'Cause I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
Beware
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
Baby I love you, but if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad
And beware, beware
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
There you go
Flashing fever from your eyes
Hey babe, come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying
We're flying above it all
Hold my hand, don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace
Ive never felt this way
Oh, show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven, please
Here I go
I'm shaking just like the breeze
Hey babe, I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying
I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
Ive shivers down my spine
And it feels divine
Oh, show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven, please
If you know what it's like
To dream a dream
Baby, hold me tight
And let this be, oh
Oh, show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh, show me heaven, please
Along she came, with her picture
Put it in a frame, so I won't miss her
Got on a plane, from London; Heathrow
It seems such a shame, yea
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone, I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now, that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
Heard she's engaged, but to her best friend
No ones to blame, here's where it all ends
And I feel the pain, 'cause I'm without her
I feel the pain
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone, I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now, that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I see the sight, with a different light
Words cannot describe the way I'm feeling
'Cause Ive been searching in my head
For the words I thought she'd said
For too long
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone, I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now, that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone, I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now, that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone, I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now, that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I could be discontent and chase the rainbows end
I might win much more but lose all that is mine
I could be a lot but I know I'm not
I'm content just with the riches that you bring 
I might shoot to win and commit the sin
Of wanting more than Ive already got
I could runaway but I'd rather stay
In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day
the one that makes me say, hehe
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away
I might be a king and steal my peoples things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule but I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way
say listen what I say
I could chase around for nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes but I'll come back in style
For I realize your love means more than anything
the song you make me sing, yeah
Sitting in my class, just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
I can't hear the teacher, his books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play...
'cause I love your smile
I love your smile
The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream, free to bathe, free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know, and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway
'cause I love your smile
I love your smile
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig
I'm showing
The life that I'm living
This is the life that I have
And it's given to you
Yeh'and it's true
La-d-da
Twinkley d
do you
Believe in a girl
like me
Shanice is the one
For you to be with
But when I'm caught
All alone
I start fessing
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder Do you still love me?
But after that
My whole world is beautiful
Blow branford
Blow
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig
Smile...Pstch
'cause I love your smile
I love your smile
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Oh, why you look so sad?
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause Ive seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
So if you're mad, get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey, what you got to hide?
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
And when
When the night falls on you baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in, into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Mm--Is she really going out with him?
Well, there she is, Let's ask her
Betty, is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing?
Mm-hm
Gee, it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today?
Mm-mm
By the way, where did you meet him?
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture
Yes, we see
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack
My folks were always putting him down
They said he came from the wrong side of town
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack
One day my dad said find someone new
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
He stood there and asked me why, but all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you, the leader of the pack
Do do
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night,
I begged him to go slow, whether he heard,
I'll never know Look out! Look out! Look out!
I felt so helpless, what could I do
Remembering all the things we'd been through?
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears, but I don't care
I'll never forget him, the leader of the pack
Ooh, the leader of the pack now he's gone
the leader of the pack now he's gone
the leader of the pack now he's gone
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
Heartbeat
Why does a love kiss stay in my memory
Piddly pat
I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
Heartbeat
Why do you skip when my babies lips meet mine
Heartbeat
Why do you flip and give me a skip each sign
Piddly pat
And sing to me love's story
And bring to me love's glory
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
I feel like I'm dragging you down a one way street 
I don't know which ways up 
All I ask of you is to stay on your feet 
That should be enough 
If we stand around it could pass us by 
We could give up now, and never even try
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
I just want something real I can hold onto 
I believe its near 
Life's too short to know the truth 
Maybe it's already hear 
We could throw ourselves into the fire 
We could give up now and never even try
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
We're chasing something we've dreamed of 
is not always out of reach
It's never far away from us 
'cause I believe that
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
Oh, my love, my darling
Ive hungered for your touch
A long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me, wait for me
I'll be coming home, wait for me
Oh, my love, my darling
Ive hungered, for your touch
A long, lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine?
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely mountains gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Waiting for the dawn of the day
All alone I gaze
At the stars, at the stars
Dreaming of my love far away
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling sadness
I'm losing, I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
So save me I'm waiting
I'm needing, hear me pleading
And soothe me, improve me
I'm grieving, I'm barely believing now, now
When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying and lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling sadness
I'm losing, I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness, now, now
When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying and lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it, nobody knows it...
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 
No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 
I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know no matter what 
If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 
And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 
I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know, I know 
I know this love's forever 
That's all that matters now 
No matter what!
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind
When your heart's on fire,
You must realize, smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away,
I am without my love 
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies, smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes, smoke gets in your eyes
Knew the signs
Wasn't right
I was stupid for a while
Swept away by you
And now I feel like a fool
So confused,
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?
Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach,
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
Catch myself
From despair
I could drown
If I stay here
Keeping busy everyday
I know I will be OK
But I was
So confused,
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you?
Out of reach, so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach,
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
So much hurt,
So much pain
Takes a while
To regain
What is lost inside
And I hope that in time
You'll be out of my mind
And I'll be over you
But now I'm
So confused,
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you
Out of reach,
So far
I never had your heart
Out of reach,
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
Out of reach,
So far
You never gave your heart
In my reach, I can see
There's a life out there
For me
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you
I hear babies crying, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams 
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night 
Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
In the wind of change 
The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me 
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change 
Say you, say me say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together
Naturally
I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out
Say you, say me it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together
Naturally
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say I'll show you
Say you, say me it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together
Naturally
So you think you know the answers, Oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right, I'm telling you
It's time to start believing oh yes
Believing who you are
You are a shining star
Say you, say me it for always
Oh that's the way it should be
Say you, say me say it together
Naturally
Say it together, naturally
Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say, but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
Now that Ive tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say, I love you
On this you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
On this you can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
Girl when you hold me, how you control me
You bend and you fold me, anyway you please
It must be easy for you, the loving things that you do
But just a pastime for you, I could never be
And I never know, girl 
If I should stay or go
Cos the games that you play 
Keep driving me away
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Kisses and caresses, are only minor tests, babe
Of love lead to stresses, between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting, isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass, girl, I'm proud to take a stand
I can't continue guessing 
Because it's only messing
With my pride and my mind 
So write down this time to time
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
I'm just a little old-fashioned
It's take more than physical attraction
My initial reaction is honey give me love
Not a facsimile of
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love 
Don't love me for fun, girl
Let me be the one, girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through' my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she blows
There she blows again
Pulsing through my vein
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes, there she goes again
She calls my name, pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
But I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Back beat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one who saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you got to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads that we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
I don't want you chew my bread
I don't want you make my bed
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you
I don't want you be no slave
I don't want you work all day
I don't want you to be sad or blue
I just want to make love to you
I can tell by the way that you baby talk
I can see by the way that you switch and walk
I can tell by the way that you treat your man
That I could love you baby it's a crying shame
I don't want you wash my clothes
I don't want you clean my home
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you
I don't want you be no slave
I don't want you work all day
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you
I don't want you keep a home
I don't want you work a gun
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone
You can tell your friends just what a fool Ive been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more
But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
You can tell your mom I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise, tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not OK
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today
But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
I can see the first leaf falling
It's all yellow and nice
It's so very cold outside
like the way I'm feeling inside
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
Outside it's now raining
and tears are falling from my eyes
Why did it have to happen
Why did it all have to end
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
I have your arms around me warm like fire
but when I open my eyes
You're gone
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do feel I will miss you much
miss you much
Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumblin' down
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach on out for me
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there, with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through
When you feel lost and about to give up
Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me
Reach out, reach out for me
I'll be there, to love and comfort you
And I'll be there, to cherish and care for you
I'll be there, with a love that will see you through
I'll be there to love and comfort you
I can tell the way you hang your head
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinkin'
You're alone now, no love of your own
But darling, reach out, come on girl, reach out for me
Reach out
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there, to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there, you can always depend on me
I'd really love to be alone without all the
Ache and pain and the April showers
But it ain't long before I long for you, like a
Ray of hope, coming through the blue moon
When it all gets dark again
The whole thing falls apart I guess
It doesn't really matter about the rain
Cause we'll get through it anyway
We'll get up and start again
Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
We could be Lifted
From the shadows, lifted
Oh we could be, lifted up today
Lifted all the way, you and I forever
Baby, lifted, lifted, lifted, hey
It's undisturbable the peace we found
In a bright new space up above the clouds
Everything is understandable
You don't have to say anything too loud
When all our luck runs out again
We're brought back down to solid ground
I wouldn't say I'm mad about the rain
But we'll get through it anyway
We'll get back to the start again
Cause we could be lifted, lifted, lifted
We could be lifted
From the shadows, lifted
Oh we could be, lifted up today
Lifted all the way, you and I forever
Baby, lifted, we could be lifted, we could be lifted, hey
We could be lifted, we could be lifted, we could be lifted
You and I forever
We could be lifted, we could be lifted, yeah we could be lifted
We could be lifted up to new horizons
Lifted, lifted up today, lifted all the way, yeah we could be lifted
We could be lifted, from the shadows, we could be lifted
Lifted up to new horizons
When it all gets dark again, it doesn't really matter about the rain
When it all gets dark again, it doesn't really matter about the rain
I'm not proud, I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
Ive been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me
All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better, should be better
For lessons in love
For restless eyes egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it, yeah
Lessons in love
Lost without love
Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn
Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait till you return
All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could lose it, we should use it
lessons in love
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better, should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it, we could use it 
Lessons in love
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
what's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
It's that ole devil called love game
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shock again
Put a ring in my eyes
Tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart
It's that sly ole sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that ring
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart
Suppose I didn't stay and ran away
Wouldn't play
That devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
He'd follow around
Build me up, tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
With that ole devil called love
Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand, you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live 
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
The world is always changing, nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side
I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live Baby, yeah
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
Let's cherish every moment we have together
For as long as we both shall live
Hand in hand, you and I
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love
Cherish the life
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
For as long as we both shall live
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
Let's cherish every moment we have together
We should cherish the life we liveHand in hand, you and I
Cherish the love, cherish the life, cherish the love
I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
Ive been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right
Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine
Remember them basement parties, your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you, you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind
But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even trying
Now I'm eating my heart out
Trying to get a letter through
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth, but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you
Anyway, my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even trying
Now I'm eating my heart out trying to get back to you
After all the years I hope it's the same address
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I love you from the bottom, of my pencil case
I love you in the songs, I write and sing
Love you because, you put me in my rightful place
And I love the PRS cheques, that you bring
Cheap, never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down, down, down, down
Oh Shirley, oh Deborah, oh Julie, oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name, I forget your name
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forget your name
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forget your name
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry
Deep so deep, the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lovey cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
For you, for you
I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
I´ve got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it´s cold outside,
I´ve got the month of May
Well, I guess you´ll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
I´ve got so much honey
The bees envy me.
I´ve got a sweeter song
Than the birds in the trees.
Well, I guess you´ll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
Ooooh, Hoooo
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
I don´t need no money
Fortune or fame
I´ve got all the riches, baby
One man can claim
Well, I guess you´ll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
Talking about my girl
I´ve got sushine on cloudy day
With my girl
I´ve even got the month of May
With my girl
Talking about, talking bout my girl
Baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby baby
I will never find another lover sweeter than you
Sweeter than you
And I will never find another lover more precious than you
More precious than you
Girl you are close to me you're like my mother
Close to me you're like my father
Close to me you're like my sister
Close to me you're like my brother
You are the only one my everything and for you this song I sing
And all my life Ive prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life Ive prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
I said you're all that I'm thinking of, baby
Said, I promise to never fall in love with a stranger
You're all I'm thinking of, I praise the Lord above
For sending me your love, I cherish every hug
I really love you
And all my life, baby, baby, Ive prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you, baby
All my life Ive prayed for someone like you
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes, I pray that you do, love me
You're all that I ever known
When you smile, on my face, all I see is a glow.
You turned my life around, you picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known
When you smile on your face all I see is a glow
You picked me up when I was down
You're all that I ever known
When you smile on your face all I see is a glow
You picked me up when I was down
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too
All my life, Ive prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life Ive prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
All my life Ive prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I, that I finally found you
All my life Ive prayed for someone like you
Yes, I pray that you do love me too
Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Want to tell you I love your way
Want to be with you night and day
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
Wonder how they have the power to shine, shine, shine
I can see them under the pine
Don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Want to tell you I love your way
Want to be with you night and day
Well don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray, blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season
Don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Want to tell you I love your way
Want to be with you night and day
Just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that were through
I just don't know what to do
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
Movies only make me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
Cause I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away
Well I don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that were through
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away
I just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
We got it together, didn't we
We've definitely got our thing together don't we baby
Isn't that nice
I mean really, when really sit and think about it
Isn't it really, really nice
I can easily feel myself slipping
In more and more ways
That super world of my own
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together baby
My first, my last, my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun, my moon, my guiding star
My kind of wonderful, that's what you are
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're, you're all I'm living for, your love I'll keep forevermore
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
In you Ive found so many things
A love so new, only you could bring
Can't you see it's you? You make me feel this way
You're like a fresh morning dew on a brand new day
I see so many ways that I
Can love you till the day I die
You're my reality, yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, the last, my everything
I know there's only, only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl, you're my reality, but I'm lost in a dream
You're the first, you're the last, my everything
You and me baby
It's you, and me
And you are the first, the last, my everything
Thanks for the times that you've given me,
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!
Your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes, your once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you, to hold you
To feel you, to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once, twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !
I was alone thinking I was just fine
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home, alone, that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
cause there I stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say what I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on my map on my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears, one consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless boundless I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
I just didn't know
until I found you baby
until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby, I don't know why you treating me so bad
You said you love me, no one above me
And I was all you had 
And though my heart is eating for you
I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way
And still I stay
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby, I don't know why you wanna do me wrong 
See when I'm home I'm all alone
And you are always gone
And, boy, you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears
After all these years
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Oh, I trusted you, I trusted you
So sad, so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies, feel me
Come on sing with me
See, when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
Never gonna change, never gonna change
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby, why you hurt me
Leave me and desert me
Boy, I gave you all my heart
And all you do is tear it up
Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
This something always hold me back
High time, we made a stand 
And shook up the views of the common man
And the love train rides from coast to coast
the man we love the most
Could you be, could you be squeaky clean and smash every hope of democracy 
As the head line says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues yeah, yeah
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
I spy tears in their eyes they look to the skies 
For some kind of divine intervention
Food goes to waste
So nice to eat, so nice to taste
Politician granny with your high ideals 
Have you no idea how the majority feels?
So with out love and a promised land
We're fools to the rules of a government plan
Kick out the style, bring back the jam, yeah, yeah
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
The birds and the bees
My girlfriend and me in love
Feel the pain
Talk about it 
If you're a worried man
Then shout about it
Open hearts fell about it
Open minds think about it
Everyone read about it
Every one scream about it 
Everyone 
Everyone read about it, read about it
Read it in the books, in the crannies and the nooks, there are books to read
(Sowing the seeds) Sowing the seeds of love, we're sowing the seeds, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love
Sowing the seeds of love
Mister England sowing the seeds of love
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes
Time to eat all your words
Swallow your pride
Open your eyes
Time to eat all your words 
Swallow your pride And the love train rides from coast to coast
Open your eyes every minute of every hour
Open your eyes I Love a sunflower
Open your eyes and I believe in love power, love power
Open your eyes 
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love

And the Politics of Greed With Love
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Sowing the seeds of love, seeds of love, sowing the seeds
Emptiness and just a memory
Love is gone with nothing left for me
All those wasted feeling for something I no longer have
I never knew that love could hurt so bad
Winter melody, winter melody, winter melody
Play for me, just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
I can't bear to see the sun go down
Casting stormy shadows all around
Nothing seems to matter, I just get by from day to day
I never thought that you would leave this way
Winter melody, winter melody, winter melody
Play for me, just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
Winter melody
Play for me, just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
Loneliness, that's all that's left for me
Happiness is chilled by winter's breeze
I keep on remembering the day that you came along
And since you left, well I just sing the song
Winter melody, winter melody, winter melody
Play for me, just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
You do something to me
Something deep inside
I'm hanging on the wire
For a love I'll never find
You do something wonderful
Then chase it all away
Mixing my emotions
That throws me back again
Hanging on the wire, yeah
I'm waiting for the change
I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
And feel real again
Hanging on the wire, yeah
Said I'm waiting for the change
Oh, I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
And feel real again
You do something to me
Somewhere deep inside
I'm hoping to get close to
A peace I cannot find 
Dancing through the fire, yeah
Just to catch a flame
Just to get close to
Just close enough 
To tell you that
You do something to me
Something deep inside
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons, they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'd hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
My world was shattered I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darling then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind
And darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do, oh
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time, whoa baby
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry, but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me, love me, like you used to do
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
Then maybe, maybe, maybe
You'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
I'm mad about the boy
And I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit the sleepless nights Ive had
About the boy
On the silverscreen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad
About the boy
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
Who's in the flurry of her first affair
Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo
In so much space
And when you are out there
Without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Probably 
And I hope you are having the time of you are life - Think twice - that's my only advice
Com on now, comn on now, come on now, whw do you think you are
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you are in control
Well, I think you are crazy
I think you are crazy
I think you are crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little, ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence Ive come
And I can die when I'm done
But Maybe I am crazy
Maybe you are crazy
Maybe we are crazy
Probably
Uh, uh
Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee grows cold
Look over there! Where
There's a lady that I used to know
She's married now, or engaged, or something, so I am told
Is she really going out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really going out with him
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here 
Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there! Where
Here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
If so, there goes your proof
Is she really going out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really going out with him
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here 
But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's more down as dead
Cause Ive had my fill
Listen you, take your hands off her head
I get so mean around this scene
Is she really going out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really going out with him
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
You look into my eyes, I go out of my mind
I can't see anything coz this love got me blind
I can't help myself, I can't break the spell
I'm in over my head
You got under my skin
I got no strength at all
In the state that I'm in
And my knees are weak
And my mouth can't speak
Fell to far this time
Baby I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep I can't sleep, I can't think
I just think about the things you do
I'm just too lost in you
Well you whisper to me
And I shiver inside
You undo me and move me in ways undefined
And you are all I see
And you are all I need
Help me baby, help me now
Cause I'm slipping away
Like the sand to the tide
Flowing into your arms, falling into your eyes
If you get too near I might disappear
I might loose my mind
Baby I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep I can't sleep, I can't think
I just think about the things you do
I'm just too lost in you
I'm going crazy with love for you baby
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I'm going down like a stone in the sea
No one can rescue me
Baby I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep I can't sleep, I can't think
I just think about the things you do
I'm just too lost in you
You look into my eyes, I go out of my mind
I'm too lost in you, I'm too lost in you
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
I just needed you to comfort me
And I have tried to make it right
And I don't know that I feel so sure
But I think that we missed out
So Ive sung this song for you
And I just want you to say to me
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
And all I wanted was to stand alone
So is there a place, that we could meet
And you see this face within your face and I
Stayed away but I'm back to hear you say
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
In the Heavens above
Can you hear me
Through the spaces
Wondering in this wonderland
And if I try to understand
This broken man, broken man
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Broken man
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
Broken man
In the Heavens, in the Heavens
In the Heavens, for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I put a spell on you because you are mine
You better stop the things that you do
I ain't lying, no, I ain't lying
I just can't stand it babe
The way you're always running around
I just can't stand it, the way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine
I put a spell on you because you're mine
You better stop the things that you do
I ain't lying, no, I ain't lying
I just can't stand it babe
The way you're always running around
I just can't stand it, the way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine
I put a spell on you. I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you. I put a spell on you
Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it, life is a wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning, and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring be a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh
Bring me a higher love oh
Bring me a higher love oh 
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love oh, oh
I said, bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh
bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love oh yeah 
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world where few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real
I keep it alive
The road is long
There are mountains in the way
But we climb a step every day
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Up where the clear winds blow
Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives looking behind
When all we have is here and now
All our lives
Out there to find
The road is long
There are mountains in the way
But we climb a step every day
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive, today
All I know 
Is everything is not as it seems
But the more I grow the less I know
And I have lived so many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see, the less I grow
The fewer the seeds the more I sow
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Try
I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people, are really not real at all
The more I learn, the more I learned
The more I cry the more I cried
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
And all I can do is try
Try
All of the moments that already passed already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be, we never will be
And that's wonderful, that's life
That's you baby
This is me baby 
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
Free
In our love 
We are free in our love
I shouldn't be alone with you tonight
Desire was too strong to put up a fight
I don't understand the way I feel although it feels so right
I really shouldn't be here tonight
In your eyes there's a sign of intensity
I sense an atmosphere 
No need to hide from the way that you feel inside
There's nothing left to fear
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance, risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
Your on my mind all of the time
I really shouldn't stay with you tonight 
But the more and more I think of it
The more it just seems right
I really shouldn't be here tonite
Now I find I don't know who I really am 
I'm lost without a trace
So take me high take me low 
Anyhow you know
And help me if you can
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance, risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
Why I don't know I'm into deep to say no
Hold me close don't let me go
I want to take this chance 
Risk it all for you
Its what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance, risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance, risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes, each one she passes goes 
When she walks, she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle that
When she passes, each one she passes goes
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her, I love you
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes, I smile but she doesn't see, doesn't see
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar
But I watch her so sadly
Porque tudo to triste
Yes, I would give my heart gladly
But each day, when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead, not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, I smile but she doesn't see
Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see
Nem olha para mim
She never sees me
Por causa do amor
Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live
Well, I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If Ive got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me, empty like before
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us 
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been
Yeah, I really need you near me tonight
Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies
If Ive got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone
Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living
Then just walk away
We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving
We don't have tomorrow
There's no tomorrow here, there's only love and the time to chase it
But we had yesterday
But yesterday's gone my love, there's only now and it's time to face it
Touch me in the morning
I sit by the harbor
The sea calls to me
I hide in the water
But I need to breath
You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away
Ive been run a ground
So sad for a sailor
I felt safe and sound
But needed the danger
You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away
You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away
Stow away
Stow away
I am not in love 
But I'm open to persuasion 
East or West 
Where's the best 
For romancing
With a friend 
I can smile 
But with a lover 
I could hold my head back 
I could really laugh 
Really laugh
Thank you 
You took me dancing 
Cross the floor 
Cheek to cheek 
But with a lover 
I could really move 
Really move 
I could really dance 
Really dance 
Really dance 
Really dance 
I could really move 
Really move 
Really move 
Really move
Now if I can feel the sun 
In my eyes 
And the rain on my face 
Why can't I 
Feel love
I can really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Love love love love 
Love love love love
Now I got all 
The friends that I want 
I may need more 
But I shall just stick to those 
That I have got 
With friends I still feel 
So insecure
Little darling I believe you could 
Help me a lot 
Just take my hand 
And lead me where you will 
No conversation 
No wave goodnight 
Just make love 
With affection
Sing me another love song 
But this time 
With a little dedication 
Sing it, sing it 
You know that's what I like 
Once more with feeling 
Give me love 
Give me love 
Give me love 
Love
She's passing this way
And if you're looking for love, she'll give it away
Yeah, we've all drunk from that cup
You'll be hooked within minutes of tasting a drop
Cause she is something, that is true
But just a kiss, my friend, you're through
Cause when she walks and leaves you blue
You'll look like the junkies standing here in front of you
But hey, you should follow your heart
Maybe she won't desire for just pulling apart
And I don't care if she does
Once she's got you in deeper, there'll be one more of us
Cause she is something, that is true
But just a kiss, my friend, you're through
Cause when she walks and leaves you blue
You'll look like the junkies standing here in front of you
The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile 
Can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got the look of love
Is on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine, tonight
Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll 
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day 
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
A world filled with love is a wonderful sight
Being in love is what's heart's delight
But that look of love isn't on my face
That enchanted feeling has been replaced
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know Ive got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe
The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows, searching for light
Cold and alone, no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who care
Always moving and going nowhere
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know Ive got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me, please
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look
There's a growing need
Oh, he is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know Ive got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know Ive got to find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere
Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hanging on
Oh honey, all I ever need is you
You're my first love, you're my last
You're my future, you're my past
And loving you is all I ask, honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go, and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring, all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul, honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say, my honey
All I ever need is you
Sometimes I feel Ive got to
Run away, Ive got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And Ive lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you 
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love 
Tainted love
Now I know Ive got to
Run away, Ive got to
Get away, you don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you 
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love 
Tainted love
Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love
Tainted love
I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no no, it's because
I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no no, it's because
I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, no no, it's because
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
Love, love changes everything 
Hands and faces, earth and sky 
Love, love changes everything 
How you live and how you die 
Love, can make the summer fly 
Or a night seem like a lifetime 
Yes love, love changes everything 
Now I tremble at your name 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 
Love, love changes everything 
Days are longer, words mean more 
Love, love changes everything 
Pain is deeper than before 
Love will turn your world around 
And that world will last forever 
Yes love, love changes everything 
Brings you glory, brings you shame 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 
Off into the world we go 
Planning futures, shaping years 
Love and suddenly all our wisdom disappears 
Love makes fools of everyone 
All the rules we made are broken 
Yes love, love changes everyone 
Live or perish in its flame 
Love will never never let you be the same 
Love will never never let you be the same 
With every look, with every touch
With every kiss, you're in my heart
With every move, with every prayer
With every beat, you're in my heart
Like a drum, my heart beats like a drum
As my mind begins to run
Back to you
Every movie that I see
The face upon the screen
It's you
With every look, with every touch
With every kiss, you're in my heart
With every move, with every prayer
With every beat, you're in my heart
In my room, your perfume fills the are
The shirt you used to wear
It's still there
In a room with so called friends
I here your voice again
Its you
With every look, with every touch
With every kiss, you're in my heart
With every move, with every prayer
With every beat, you're in my heart
And in my heart, there's a photograph of you
For all the world to see
And in my heart there's a picture of you
Walking away, from me
With every look, with every touch
With every kiss, you're in my heart
With every move, with every prayer
With every beat, you're in my heart
With every look, with every touch
With every kiss, you're in my heart
With every move, with every prayer
With every beat, you're in my heart
Just smile for me and let the day begin
You are the sunshine that lights my heat within
I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise
Come take my hand and together we will rise
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high Upon the wings of love
You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
I'm crazy bout ya baby can't you see
I'd be delighted if you could come with me
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high Upon the wings of love
Yes you belong to me
I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live and breathe Each other
Inseparable it seems
We're flowing like a stream
Running free flowing
On the wings of love
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Together flying high
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Together flying high
Upon the wings of love
