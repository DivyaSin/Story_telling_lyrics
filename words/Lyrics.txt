Once upon a time, there was a boy very lane
For some reason I cant explain .He feared of wars
This year , to save me from tears .He took a ride
Makes you wanna run and hide .The weather was sunny
To roll your eyes at , honey .Fishes were in the sea
Tell me .So clear was the sky
The way you move when you walk by .It was a beautiful sight.When everything ' s gonna go just right .
