Dead leaves and the dirty ground
when I know you're not around
shiny tops and soda pops
when I hear your lips make a sound
Thirty notes in the mailbox
will tell you that I'm coming home
and I think I'm gonna stick around
for a while so you're not alone
If you can hear a piano fall
you can hear me coming down the hall
if I could just hear your pretty voice
I don't think I need to see at all
Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
and every breath that is in your lungs
is a tiny little gift to me
I didn't feel so bad till the sun went down
then I come home
no one to wrap my arms around
Well any man with a microphone
can tell you what he loves the most
and you know why you love at all
if you're thinking of the holy ghost
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss, it put could creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just Postmix lemonade
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt, girl, that's a sawn-off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri-La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
"Baby, I was made to break your heart"
Suck it and see, you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go, go, go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me 'cause I'm a fool for you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love this girl is only gonna break your heart

With you
With you this girl is only gonna break your heart
What a wicked game you played to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
And I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
This girl is only gonna break your heart
Nobody loves no one
I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face
The wouldn't let me sleep
And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you dear
Everything has changed
My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore dear
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
So lift off love
So lift off love
And we took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
So lift off love
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Once I walked a lonely road
I had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
Lonely days of uncertainty
They disappear when you're near me
When you're around my life's worthwhile
And now I long to see you smile
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
My life is right
My life is right
My life is right
Once I walked a lonely road
I had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right, so right
My life is right
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
I noticed you
You stood out like a sore thumb
The most
Beautiful sore thumb I'd ever seen
I took you out
And showed you a good time
We danced all night
And I waited till the time was right when
I was almost sick on you
Echo echo of mine
Do you recall
The night that we first met
And how I burnt your dress
With my cigarette
I don't know why
But I played this game
For you
I'm guessing it's just what all young lovers do
You say
That it's never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Echo echo of mine
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
So echo on
Echo on
Echo on
Echo
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain, you said
And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second
I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain, you said
And it's all running out like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
It's just the way I smile, you said
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And is it happens
It happens here in this house
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And there's someone
Calling on the telephone
Let's stay home
It's cold outside
And I have so much
To confide to you
With or without words
I'll confide everything
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here in this house
So we stay at home
And I'm by your side
And you know
What's going on inside
Inside my heart
Inside this house
And I just want to
Let it out for you
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
And oh, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
Twenty miles left to the show.
Hello, my old country. Hello.
Stars are just beginning to appear,
and I have never, in my life,
before been here.
And it's my heart, not me,
who cannot drive,
at which conclusion you arrived,
watching me sit here, bolt upright,
and cry for no good reason
at the Eastering sky.
And the tilt of this strange nation,
and the will to remain for the duration
waving the flag
feeling it drag
Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby
like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby
step, ball-change, and a-pirouette
And I regret, I regret
how I said to you
Honey, just open your heart
when I've got trouble
even opening a honey jar
And that, right there, is where we are
And I've been 'fessing, double-fast
addressing questions nobody asked
I'll get this joy off of my chest, at last
and I will love you
till the noise has long since passed 
And I did not mean to shout, Just drive
Just get us out, dead or alive 
The road's too long to mention —
Lord, it's something to see! —
laid down by the
Good Intentions Paving Company,
all the way to the thing
we've been playing at, darling.
I can see that you're wearing
your staying-hat, darling.
And for the time being, all is well.
Won't you love me a spell?
This is blindness, beyond all conceiving,
while behind us, the road is leaving,
and leaving, and falling back
like a rope gone slack.
And, I saw straightaway
that the lay was steep,
but I fell for you, honey,
easy as falling asleep.
And that, right there,
is the course I keep.
And no amount of talking
is going to soften the fall,
but, like after the rain,
step out of the overhang. That's all.
It had a nice ring to it,
when the old opry house rang,
so, with a solemn auld lang
syne, sealed, delivered,
I sang.
And there is hesitation,
and it always remains
(concerning you, me,
and the rest of the gang),
but, in our quiet hour,
I feel I see everything,
and am in love
with the hook
upon which everyone hangs.
And I know you meant
to show the extent
to which you gave a goddang —
you ranged real hot and real cold,
but I'm sold,
I am at home on that range.
And I do hate to fold,
right here, at the top of my game,
when I've been trying
with my whole heart and soul
to stay right here, in the right lane.
But it can make you feel over, and old
(Lord, you know it's a shame),
when I only want for you to pull over,
and hold me,
till I can't remember my own name.
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door 
Of an empty room 
And you go inside and set a table for one, it's no fun 
When you spend a day 
Without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
We burst the pretty balloon, took us to the moon 
It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie 
If I said I'd rather die, than live without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing 
And it grooves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part 
And it's breaking my heart 
To have to spend another day without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo doo
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her
Doo doo, doo doo doo
Can't go on without her 
Doo doo, doo doo doo
There's no song without her 
It's all wrong without her 
Can't go on without her
Take me out tonight 
Where there's music and there's people 
And they're young and alive 
Driving in your car 
I never never want to go home 
Because I haven't got one 
Anymore 
Take me out tonight 
Because I want to see people and I 
Want to see life 
Driving in your car 
Oh, please don't drop me home 
Because it's not my home, it's their
Home, and I'm welcome no more 
And if a double-decker bus 
Crashes into us 
To die by your side 
Is such a heavenly way to die 
And if a ten-ton truck 
Kills the both of us 
To die by your side 
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine 
Take me out tonight 
Take me anywhere, I don't care 
I don't care, I don't care 
And in the darkened underpass 
I thought oh God, my chance has come at last
(but then a strange fear gripped me and I 
Just couldn't ask) 
Take me out tonight 
Oh, take me anywhere, I don't care 
I don't care, I don't care 
Driving in your car 
I never never want to go home 
Because I haven't got one, da... 
Oh, I haven't got one 
And if a double-decker bus 
Crashes into us 
To die by your side 
Is such a heavenly way to die 
And if a ten-ton truck 
Kills the both of us 
To die by your side 
Well, the pleasure - the privilege is mine 
Oh, there is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And I'm pushin' on the door
Could you find me?
Would you kiss-a my eyes?
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
There you go
Standin' with the look of avarice
Talkin' to Huddie Ledbetter
Showin' pictures on the wall
Whisperin' in the hall
And pointin' a finger at me
There you go, there you go
Standin' in the sun darlin'
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before
There you go
Takin' good care of your boy
Seein' that he's got clean clothes
Puttin' on his little red shoes
I see you know he's got clean clothes
A-puttin' on his little red shoes
A-pointin' a finger at me
And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Lookin' straight at you
Comin' through, darlin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dreams
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me
Would you kiss-a my eyes
Lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again
In another world
In another world
In another time
Got a home on high
Ain't nothing but a stranger in this world
I'm nothing but a stranger in this world
I got a home on high
In another land
So far away
So far away
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
We are goin' up to heaven
We are goin' to heaven
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
In another face
Two atoms they collide in all their random ways
The meeting of you and I not so random some might say
She walks up close to me and she looks me in the eyes
She said
"Boy, what's it gonna be, now that it's just you and I?"
I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
So I stepped up to the plate to a place I thought I'd never be
So I'm thanking you today because of you I am now me
Cold days them dark and blue when we was our only friend
For all that we've been through and will go through again
For that I say
I will come and I will stand
And I will live my life beside you
I'm a proud, a proud man, but all the same I'm
I'm just a fool, I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
Two atoms they collide, you and I we make them child
What lovely creatures they are, something right from the stars
And I helped you bring them forth
I offered a safe place to land
An overflow of love, falling right into my hands
For that I say
I will come and I will stand
And I will live my life beside you
I'm a proud, a proud man
A proud man to be walkin right next to your shoes
You're the one, the only one, the only one that's just right just for me
But all the same, you know I, you know I'm, I'm just a fool
I'm a fool for you, I'm a fool, I'm a fool for you
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace 
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives 
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living, I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands, your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll sail around the world
I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take?
How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays?
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
A trail for the devil to erase
San Francisco's calling us, the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza, New York catcher, are you straight or are you gay?
We hung about the stadium, we've got no place to stay
We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read, it always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may
I love you
I've a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you, my responsibility has found a place beside you
And strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
"You'll take care of her, I know it, you will do a better job"
Maybe, but not what she deserves
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare
The catcher hits for 318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench
I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love, my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like "Walk Away, Renee"
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour
Meet you at the statue in an hour
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song, oh yeah
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known, oh yeah
You smiled, you smiled oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a National guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war
I'm going to Graceland
Graceland
In Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But I've reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland

She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But I've reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling, flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh, so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
In Graceland, in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love, every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe I've a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
I smell smoke that comes from a gun
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
It was a long time ago, could have happened to anyone
He was struck by a bullet and he melted into fluid
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
Extinction
One thousand miles an hour, I'm just like anyone
I want to feel the road of tar beneath the wheel
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
And evolving from the sea would no be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something about a son of a gun
Named extinction
Extinction
Extinction
All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
The light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
Once again
Gone are the days of rainbows
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks
Straight at you
But I'll come a-running
Straight to you
But I'll come a-running
One more time
Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk howling at the moon
The chariots of angels are colliding
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
I love you from the bottom, of my pencil case
I love you in the songs, I write and sing
Love you because, you put me in my rightful place
And I love the PRS cheques, that you bring
Cheap, never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down, down, down, down
Oh Shirley, oh Deborah, oh Julie, oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name, I forget your name
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forget your name
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I forget your name
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face
And I love you 'till my fountain pen runs dry
Deep so deep, the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep, so cry, lovey cry, cry, cry, cry
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
Oh Cathy, oh Alison, oh Phillipa, oh Sue
You made me so much money, I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer, Alison, Phillipa, Sue, Deborah, Annabel, too
For you, for you
I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Tender is the night
Lying by your side
Tender is the touch
Of someone that you love too much
Tender is the day
The demons go away

Waiting for that feeling to come
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why

Oh my baby
Oh my baby
Oh why
Oh my
Oh my baby
Oh my baby
I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
A way to make you smile
I read bad poetry
Into your machine
I save your messages
Just to hear your voice.
You always listen carefully
To awkwards rhymes.
You always say your name.
Like I wouldn't know it's you
At your most beautiful.
I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
A way to make you smile
At my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly.
With every one, whisper I love you.
I let you sleep.
I know you're closed eye watching me,
Listening.
I thought I saw a smile.
I've found a way to make you
I've found a way
A way to make you smile
So be it, I'm your crowbar
If that's what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess
And I will pretend
That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time, all the time
I'll know, I'll know
And you can use my skin
To bury your secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion 
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time all the time
I'll know I'll know
Baby-I can't help you out,
While she's still around
For the time being, 
I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense
All the time give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtains,
I'll wait by the backstage door
While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for a encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so
It's ok, don't need to say it
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searchin' in the sun for another overload
I hear you singin' in the wire,
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
And I need you more than want you,
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No, my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues
Let the camera linger on your perfect skin
Your widows peak and your lucky grin
And the bluest eyes I know
As you turn to go
Let there be a record of your gorgeous voice
The turn of phrase that filled my days with joy
Something like Bing singing soft and low
As you turn to go
I know I'm not supposed to say, "I'm sorry"
I know you've had more loves than Mata Hari
But you know you're the star of my life story
And I'm so sorry
Let the poets struggle to describe your heart
Your art of love and your love of art
Well, if you ever loved me, tell me so
As you turn to go
