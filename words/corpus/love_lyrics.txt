Dead leaves and the dirty ground
when I know you're not around
shiny tops and soda pops
when I hear your lips make a sound
Thirty notes in the mailbox
will tell you that I'm coming home
and I think I'm gonna stick around
for a while so you're not alone
If you can hear a piano fall
you can hear me coming down the hall
if I could just hear your pretty voice
I don't think I need to see at all
Soft hair and a velvet tongue
I want to give you what you give to me
and every breath that is in your lungs
is a tiny little gift to me
I didn't feel so bad till the sun went down
then I come home
no one to wrap my arms around
Well any man with a microphone
can tell you what he loves the most
and you know why you love at all
if you're thinking of the holy ghost
Your love is like a studded leather headlock
Your kiss it put could creases in the rain
You're rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock
And those other girls are just Postmix lemonade
Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie blue shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
I poured my aching heart into a pop song
I couldn't get the hang of poetry
That's not a skirt girl that's a sawn off shotgun
And I can only hope you've got it aimed at me
Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Jigsaw women with hollow movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for
Blue moon girls from once upon a Shangri La
How I often wonder where you are
You have got that face that just says
Baby I was made to break your heart
Suck it and see you never know
Sit next to me before I go
Go go go
Jigsaw women with horror movie shoes
Be cruel to me cause I'm a fool for you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you
With you this girl is only gonna break your heart
What a wicked game you played to make me feel this way
What a wicked thing to do to let me dream of you
What a wicked thing to say you never felt this way
What a wicked thing to do to make me dream of you
And I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do
I'd never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you
And I'd never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you
No I don't want to fall in love
this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I don't want to fall in love 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
With you this girl is only gonna break your heart
No I 
this girl is only gonna break your heart
This girl is only gonna break your heart
Nobody loves no one
I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self same face
The wouldn't let me sleep
And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you dear
Everything has changed
My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore dear
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens violins
Everything has changed
So lift off love
So lift off love
And we took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed
You make the moon our mirror ball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
So lift off love
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Lift off love
All down to you dear
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Once I walked a lonely road
I had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right so right
Lonely days of uncertainty
They disappear when you're near me
When you're around my life's worthwhile
And now I long to see you smile
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right so right
My life is right
My life is right
My life is right
Once I walked a lonely road
I had no one to share my love
But then you came and showed the way
And now I hope you're here to stay
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
You give me light
You are my day
You give me life
And that's right
So right
So right so right
My life is right
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
I noticed you
You stood out like a sore thumb
The most
Beautiful sore thumb I'd ever seen
I took you out
And showed you a good time
We danced all night
And I waited till the time was right when
I was almost sick on you
Echo echo of mine
Do you recall
The night that we first met
And how I burnt your dress
With my cigarette
I don't know why
But I played this game
For you
I'm guessing it's just what all young lovers do
You say
That it's never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Echo echo of mine
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
Never wrong never right
So echo on
Echo on
Echo on
Echo
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
It's just what all young lovers do
I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain you said
And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world you said
And it's so cold it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second
I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain you said
And it's all running out like it's the end of the world you said
And it's so cold it's like the cold if you were dead
And you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
It's just the way I smile you said
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And is it happens
It happens here in this house
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And there's someone
Calling on the telephone
Let's stay home
It's cold outside
And I have so much
To confide to you
With or without words
I'll confide everything
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here in this house
So we stay at home
And I'm by your side
And you know
What's going on inside
Inside my heart
Inside this house
And I just want to
Let it out for you
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
Here is the house
Where it all happens
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I would never do you wrong
Ive known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
And oh there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
Twenty miles left to the show
Hello my old country Hello
Stars are just beginning to appear
and I have never in my life
before been here
And it's my heart not me
who cannot drive
at which conclusion you arrived
watching me sit here bolt upright
and cry for no good reason
at the Eastering sky
And the tilt of this strange nation
and the will to remain for the duration
waving the flag
feeling it drag
Like a bump on a bump on a log baby
like I'm in a fistfight with the fog baby
step ball-change and a-pirouette
And I regret I regret
how I said to you
Honey just open your heart
when Ive got trouble
even opening a honey jar
And that right there is where we are
And Ive been fessing double-fast
addressing questions nobody asked
I'll get this joy off of my chest at last
and I will love you
till the noise has long since passed 
And I did not mean to shout Just drive
Just get us out dead or alive 
The road's too long to mention 
Lord it's something to see! 
laid down by the
Good Intentions Paving Company
all the way to the thing
we've been playing at darling
I can see that you're wearing
your staying-hat darling
And for the time being all is well
Won't you love me a spell
This is blindness beyond all conceiving
while behind us the road is leaving
and leaving and falling back
like a rope gone slack
And I saw straightaway
that the lay was steep
but I fell for you honey
easy as falling asleep
And that right there
is the course I keep.
And no amount of talking
is going to soften the fall
but like after the rain
step out of the overhang. That's all.
It had a nice ring to it
when the old opry house rang
so with a solemn auld lang
syne sealed delivered
I sang.
And there is hesitation
and it always remains
concerning you me
and the rest of the gang
but in our quiet hour
I feel I see everything
and am in love
with the hook
upon which everyone hangs.
And I know you meant
to show the extent
to which you gave a goddang
you ranged real hot and real cold
but I'm sold
I am at home on that range.
And I do hate to fold
right here at the top of my game
when Ive been trying
with my whole heart and soul
to stay right here in the right lane.
But it can make you feel over and old
Lord you know it's a shame
when I only want for you to pull over
and hold me
till I can't remember my own name.
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her 
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
It's just no good anymore when you walk through the door 
Of an empty room 
And you go inside and set a table for one it's no fun 
When you spend a day 
Without her
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
We burst the pretty balloon took us to the moon 
It's such a beautiful thing 
But it's ended now 
And it sounds like a lie 
If I said I'd rather die than live without her
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Love is a beautiful thing when it knows how to swing 
And it grooves like a clock 
But the hands on the clock tell the lovers to part 
And it's breaking my heart 
To have to spend another day without her
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
I spend the night in a chair thinking she'll be there 
But she never comes 
And then I wake up and wipe the sleep from my eyes 
And I rise to face another day 
Without her
Doo doo doo doo doo
Can't go on without her 
Doo doo doo doo doo
There's no song without her 
It's all wrong without her 
Can't go on without her
Take me out tonight 
Where there's music and there's people 
And they're young and alive 
Driving in your car 
I never never want to go home 
Because I haven't got one 
Anymore 
Take me out tonight 
Because I want to see people and I 
Want to see life 
Driving in your car 
Oh please don't drop me home 
Because it's not my home it's their
Home and I'm welcome no more 
And if a double-decker bus 
Crashes into us 
To die by your side 
Is such a heavenly way to die 
And if a ten-ton truck 
Kills the both of us 
To die by your side 
Well the pleasure - the privilege is mine 
Take me out tonight 
Take me anywhere I don't care 
I don't care I don't care 
And in the darkened underpass 
I thought oh God my chance has come at last
but then a strange fear gripped me and I 
Just couldn't ask 
Take me out tonight 
Oh take me anywhere I don't care 
I don't care I don't care 
Driving in your car 
I never never want to go home 
Because I haven't got one da... 
Oh I haven't got one 
And if a double-decker bus 
Crashes into us 
To die by your side 
Is such a heavenly way to die 
And if a ten-ton truck 
Kills the both of us 
To die by your side 
Well the pleasure - the privilege is mine 
Oh there is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out 
There is a light and it never goes out
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dream
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me
Would you kiss-a my eyes
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
From the far side of the ocean
If I put the wheels in motion
And I stand with my arms behind me
And I'm pushing on the door
Could you find me
Would you kiss-a my eyes
To lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
There you go
Standing with the look of avarice
Talking to Huddie Ledbetter
Showing pictures on the wall
Whispering in the hall
And pointing a finger at me
There you go there you go
Standing in the sun darling
With your arms behind you
And your eyes before
There you go
Taking good care of your boy
Seeing that he's got clean clothes
Putting on his little red shoes
I see you know he's got clean clothes
A-putting on his little red shoes
A-pointing a finger at me
And here I am
Standing in your sad arrest
Trying to do my very best
Looking straight at you
Coming through darling
Yeah yeah yeah
If I ventured in the slipstream
Between the viaducts of your dreams
Where immobile steel rims crack
And the ditch in the back roads stop
Could you find me
Would you kiss-a my eyes
Lay me down
In silence easy
To be born again
To be born again
To be born again
In another world
In another world
In another time
Got a home on high
Ain't nothing but a stranger in this world
I'm nothing but a stranger in this world
I got a home on high
In another land
So far away
So far away
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
Way up in the heaven
Way up in the heaven
We are going up to heaven
We are going to heaven
In another time
In another place
In another time
In another place
In another face
Two atoms they collide in all their random ways
The meeting of you and I not so random some might say
She walks up close to me and she looks me in the eyes
She said
Boy what's it gonna be now that it's just you and I
I'm a fool I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool I'm a fool for you
So I stepped up to the plate to a place I thought I'd never be
So I'm thanking you today because of you I am now me
Cold days them dark and blue when we was our only friend
For all that we've been through and will go through again
For that I say
I will come and I will stand
And I will live my life beside you
I'm a proud a proud man but all the same I'm
I'm just a fool I'm a fool for you
I'm a fool I'm a fool for you
Two atoms they collide you and I we make them child
What lovely creatures they are something right from the stars
And I helped you bring them forth
I offered a safe place to land
An overflow of love falling right into my hands
For that I say
I will come and I will stand
And I will live my life beside you
I'm a proud a proud man
A proud man to be walking right next to your shoes
You're the one the only one the only one that's just right just for me
But all the same you know I you know I'm I'm just a fool
I'm a fool for you I'm a fool I'm a fool for you
I'll drown my beliefs
To have you be in peace 
I'll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don't leave
Don't leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives 
On lollipops and crisps
Just don't leave
Don't leave
I'm not living I'm just killing time
Your tiny hands your crazy-kitten smile
Just don't leave
Don't leave
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll sail around the world
I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl
How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take
How many nights of limping round on pagan holidays
Oh elope with me in private and we'll set something ablaze
A trail for the devil to erase
San Francisco's calling us the Giants and Mets will play
Piazza New York catcher are you straight or are you gay
We hung about the stadium we've got no place to stay
We hung about the Tenderloin and tenderly you tell
About the saddest book you ever read it always makes you cry
The statue's crying too and well he may
I love you
Ive a drowning grip on your adoring face
I love you my responsibility has found a place beside you
And strong warnings in the guise of gentle words
Come wave upon me from the family wider net absurd
You'll take care of her I know it you will do a better job
Maybe but not what she deserves
Elope with me Miss Private and we'll drink ourselves awake
We'll taste the coffee houses and award certificates
A privy seal to keep the feel of 1960 style
We'll comment on the decor and we'll help the passer by
And at dusk when work is over we'll continue the debate
In a borrowed bedroom virginal and spare
The catcher hits for 318 and catches every day
The pitcher puts religion first and rests on holidays
He goes into cathedrals and lies prostrate on the floor
He knows the drink affects his speed he's praying for a doorway
Back into the life he wants and the confession of the bench
Life outside the diamond is a wrench
I wish that you were here with me to pass the dull weekend
I know it wouldn't come to love my heroine pretend
A lady stepping from the songs we love until this day
You'd settle for an epitaph like Walk Away Renee
The sun upon the roof in winter will draw you out like a flower
Meet you at the statue in an hour
Meet you at the statue in an hour
At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song oh yeah
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped up clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I could speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill Ive never known oh yeah
You smiled you smiled oh and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last
The Mississippi Delta was shining
Like a National guitar
I am following the river
Down the highway
Through the cradle of the civil war
I'm going to Graceland
Graceland
In Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
My traveling companion is nine years old
He is the child of my first marriage
But Ive reason to believe
We both will be received
In Graceland
She comes back to tell me she's gone
As if I didn't know that
As if I didn't know my own bed
As if I'd never noticed
The way she brushed her hair from her forehead
And she said losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
I'm going to Graceland
Memphis Tennessee
I'm going to Graceland
Poor boys and pilgrims with families
And we are going to Graceland
And my traveling companions
Are ghosts and empty sockets
I'm looking at ghosts and empties
But Ive reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
There is a girl in New York City
Who calls herself the human trampoline
And sometimes when I'm falling flying
Or tumbling in turmoil I say
Oh so this is what she means
She means we're bouncing into Graceland
And I see losing love
Is like a window in your heart
Everybody sees you're blown apart
Everybody sees the wind blow
In Graceland in Graceland
I'm going to Graceland
For reasons I cannot explain
There's some part of me wants to see
Graceland
And I may be obliged to defend
Every love every ending
Or maybe there's no obligations now
Maybe Ive a reason to believe
We all will be received
In Graceland
I smell smoke that comes from a gun
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
It was a long time ago could have happened to anyone
He was struck by a bullet and he melted into fluid
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
Extinction
One thousand miles an hour I'm just like anyone
I want to feel the road of tar beneath the wheel
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named extinction
Named
And evolving from the sea would no be too much time for me
To walk beside you in the sun
I read something about a son of a gun
Named extinction
Extinction
Extinction
All the towers of ivory are crumbling
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks
This is the time of our great undoing
This is the time that I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
The light in our window is fading
The candle gutters on the ledge
Well now sorrow it comes a-stealing
And I'll cry girl but I'll come a-running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
Once again
Gone are the days of rainbows
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars
For the sea will swallow up the mountains
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks
Straight at you
But I'll come a-running
Straight to you
But I'll come a-running
One more time
Heaven has denied us its kingdom
The saints are drunk howling at the moon
The chariots of angels are colliding
Well I'll run babe but I'll come running
Straight to you
For I am captured
Straight to you
For I am captured
One more time
I love you from the bottom of my pencil case
I love you in the songs I write and sing
Love you because you put me in my rightful place
And I love the PRS cheques that you bring
Cheap never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down down down down
Oh Shirley oh Deborah oh Julie oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name I forget your name
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I forget your name
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I forget your name
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face
And I love you 'till my fountain pen runs dry
Deep so deep the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep so cry lovey cry cry cry cry
Oh Cathy oh Alison oh Phillipa oh Sue
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
Oh Cathy oh Alison oh Phillipa oh Sue
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
For you for you
I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you

Ive found a way to make you
Ive found a way
A way to make you smile
I read bad poetry
Into your machine
I save your messages
Just to hear your voice.
You always listen carefully
To awkwards rhymes.
You always say your name.
Like I wouldn't know it's you
At your most beautiful.
Ive found a way to make you
Ive found a way
A way to make you smile
At my most beautiful
I count your eyelashes secretly.
With every one whisper I love you.
I let you sleep.
I know you're closed eye watching me
Listening.
I thought I saw a smile.
Ive found a way to make you
Ive found a way
A way to make you smile
So be it I'm your crowbar
If that's what I am so far
Until you get out of this mess
And I will pretend
That I don't know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess
But all the time all the time
I'll know I'll know
And you can use my skin
To bury your secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion 
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time all the time
I'll know I'll know
Baby-I can't help you out
While she's still around
For the time being 
I'm being patient
And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don't make sense
All the time give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtains
I'll wait by the backstage door
While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open hoping for a encore
And if it gets too late for me to wait
For you to find you love me and tell me so
It's ok don't need to say it
I am a lineman for the county
And I drive the main road
Searching in the sun for another overload
I hear you singing in the wire
I can hear you through the whine
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
I know I need a small vacation
But it don't look like rain
And if it snows that stretch down south won't ever stand the strain
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
And I need you more than want you
And I want you for all time
And the Wichita lineman is still on the line
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
He's my sunshine in the morning
He's my fireworks at the end of the day
He's the warmest chord I ever heard
Play that warm chord play and stay baby
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
My old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
Then he comes home
And he takes me in his loving arms
And he tells me all his troubles
And he tells me all my charms
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No my old man
Keeping away my blues
But when he's gone
Me and them lonesome blues collide
The bed's too big
The frying pan's too wide
My old man
He's a singer in the park
He's a walker in the rain
He's a dancer in the dark
We don't need no piece of paper
From the city hall
Keeping us tied and true
No my old man
Keeping away my lonesome blues
Let the camera linger on your perfect skin
Your widows peak and your lucky grin
And the bluest eyes I know
As you turn to go
Let there be a record of your gorgeous voice
The turn of phrase that filled my days with joy
Something like Bing singing soft and low
As you turn to go
I know I'm not supposed to say I'm sorry
I know you've had more loves than Mata Hari
But you know you're the star of my life story
And I'm so sorry
Let the poets struggle to describe your heart
Your art of love and your love of art
Well if you ever loved me tell me so
As you turn to go
If you're not the one then why does my soul feel glad today
If you're not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way
If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call
If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all
I never know what the future brings
But I know you are here with me now
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
I don't want to run away but I can't take it I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms
If I don't need you then why am I crying on my bed
If I don't need you then why does your name resound in my head
If you're not for me then why does this distance maim my life
If you're not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife
I don't know why you're so far away
But I know that this much is true
We'll make it through
And I hope you are the one I share my life with
And I wish that you could be the one I die with
And I pray in you're the one I build my home with
I hope I love you all my life
I don't want to run away but I can't take it  I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way that I can stay in your arms
Cause I miss you body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away
And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today
Cause I love you whether it's wrong or right
And though I can't be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side
I don't want to run away but I can't take it
I don't understand
If I'm not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am
Is there any way I can stay in your arms
Eva eva eva uh

Life is tough if you fall

You you are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah honey it's you
You are my one temptation
You give me the thrill that I'm addicted to
Ah you're my one temptation
You can look you can't touch
Nothing is free if you pay too much
When there's talk on the street and the pressure is hot
You want more than you got
Don't hear what they're saying day out and day in
You you are my one temptation
Ooh you are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah nobody knows you are my one temptation
Ooh give me the thrill that I'm addicted to
You're my one temptation oh
Nothin' ever happens 'til you show your face around
Can't let you see that you've turned my world around
A love that's gone and yet too strong to say no
The only one who could lead me on
You're the one you're the only one
You you are my one temptation ooh
You are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah honey it's you
You you are my one temptation
You give me the thrill oh baby
You you are my one temptation ooh
You are the one Ive no resistance to
Yeah honey it's you

You give me the thrill oh baby
Don't know why 
I'm survivin' every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end
And it doesn't matter how I cry
My tears so far are a waste of time
If I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you
I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you uh-huh oh
If I can't have you

If I can't have you uh-hoh

I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Oh Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate
I don't care if Monday's black
Tuesday Wednesday heart attack
Thursday never looking back
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday you can hold your head
Tuesday Wednesday stay in bed
Or Thursday watch the walls instead
It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late
But Friday never hesitate
Dressed up to the eyes
It's a wonderful surprise
To see your shoes and your spirits rise
Throwing out your frown
And just smiling at the sound
And as sleek as a shriek
Spinning round and round
Always take a big bite
It's such a gorgeous sight
To see you in the middle of the night
You can never get enough
Enough of this stuff
It's Friday
I'm in love
I don't care if Monday's blue
Tuesday's gray and Wednesday too
Thursday I don't care about you
It's Friday I'm in love
Monday you can fall apart
Tuesday Wednesday break my heart
Thursday doesn't even start
It's Friday I'm in love
People say I'm the life of the party
Because I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you need you
Since you left me if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute
She's just a substitute
Because you're the permanent one
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
I need you need you
Outside I'm masquerading
Inside my hope is fading
Just a clown oh yeah
Since you put me down
My smile is my make up
I wear since my break up with you
So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears
If you if you could return
Don't let it burn
Don't let it fade
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining every day
For me
I swore I would be true
And fellow so did you
So why were you holding her hand
Is that the way we stand
Were you lying all the time
Was it just a game to you
But I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do you have to let it linger
Do you have to do you have to do have to let it linger
Oh I thought the world of you
I thought nothing could go wrong
But I was wrong I was wrong
If you if you could get by
Trying not to lie
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
But you always really knew
I just want to be with you
And I'm in so deep
You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do have to let it linger
Do you have to do you have to do have to let it linger
And I'm in so deep

You've got me wrapped around your finger

You know I'm such a fool for you
You've got me wrapped around your finger
Do have to let it linger
Do you have to do you have to do have to let it linger

The love that's all around me
And so the feeling grows
It's written on the wind
It's everywhere I go
So if you really love me
Come on and let it show
You know I love you I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning there'll be no end
Cause on my love you can depend
I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I cannot get to thinking
Of all the things you said
You gave your promise to me and I gave mine to you
I need someone beside me in everything I do
You know I love you I always will
My mind's made up by the way that I feel
There's no beginning there'll be no end

Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never tear us apart
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
I told you
That we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart
I

I was running late for work
So I didn't change my shirt
The evening's drinks left a lingering taste in my mouth
And when I left you were fast asleep
Tangled in the sheets
And on the bus I could have sworn 
It was all a dream
And it didn't happen to me
And then I felt the scrapes
From the slippery subway grate
Oh how you laughed
At my complete lack of grace
But I could not recall
A more perfect fall
'Cause when I looked up into your eyes
It didn't hurt at all
And I thought be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here 
With me in the morning
And I thought be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here 
With me in the morning
Be still my heart
This could be a brand new start with you
And it will be clear
If I wake up and you're still here 
With me in the morning
Nothing you could say could tear me away from my guy
My guy
Nothing you could do 'cause I'm stuck like glue to my guy.
My guy
I'm sticking to my guy like a stamp to a letter
Like birds of a feather we stick together

My guy
Nothing you could buy could make me tell a lie to my guy.

As a matter of opinion I think he's tops
My opinion is he's the cream of the crop;
As a matter of taste to be exact he's my ideal as a matter of fact.
No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.
My guy
No handsome face could ever take the place of my guy.
My guy
He may not be a movie star but when it comes to bein' happy we are.
There's not a man today who could take me away from my guy.
No muscle-bound man could take my hand from my guy.

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise
'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you
'Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see
Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last
You went and saved the best for last
I'm not a perfect person
There's many thing I wish I didn't do
But I continue learning
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
Ive found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
I'm sorry that I hurt you
It's something I must live with everyday
And all the pain I put you through
I wish I could take it all away
And be the one who catches all your tears
That's why I need you to hear
Ive found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you x4
I'm not a perfect person
I never meant to do those things to you
And so I have to say before I go
That I just want you to know
Ive found a reason for me
To change who I used to be
A reason to start over new
And the reason is you
Ive found a reason to show
A side of me you didn't know
A reason for all that I do
And the reason is you
Ive never seen you looking so lovely as you did tonight
Ive never seen you shine so bright
Ive never seen so many men ask you if you wanted to dance
They're looking for a little romance given half a chance
And I have never seen that dress you're wearing
Or the highlights in your hair that catch your eyes
I have been blind
The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
There's nobody here it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight
Ive never seen you looking so gorgeous as you did tonight
Ive never seen you shine so bright you were amazing
Ive never seen so many people want to be there by your side
And when you turned to me and smiled it took my breath away
And I have never had such a feeling
Such a feeling of complete and utter love as I do tonight
The lady in red is dancing with me cheek to cheek
There's nobody here it's just you and me
It's where I want to be
But I hardly know this beauty by my side
I'll never forget the way you look tonight
I never will forget the way you look tonight
The lady in red the lady in red
The lady in red my lady in red

But honey honey don't stop 
But honey honey don't stop 
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I needed the shelter of someone's arms and there you were
I needed someone to understand my ups and downs
and there you were
With sweet love and devotion
deeply touching my emotion
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
I close my eyes at night
wondering where would I be without you in my life
Everything I did was just a bore
everywhere I went it seems I'd been there before
But you brightened up for me all of my days
With a love so sweet in so many ways
I want to stop and thank you baby
I want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
You were better to me than Ive been to myself
For me there's you and there ain't nobody else
I want to stop and thank you baby
I just want to stop and thank you baby
How sweet it is to be loved by you
How sweet it is to be loved by you
She was born in November 1963
The day Aldous Huxley died
And her mama believed
That every man could be free
So her mama got high high high
And her daddy marched on Birmingham
Singing mighty protest songs
And he pictured all the places
That he knew that she belonged
But he failed and taught her young
The only thing she's need to carry on
He taught her how to
Run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run
Past the arms of the familiar
And their talk of better days
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
so long
Baby loves to run
She counts out all her money
In the taxi on the way to meet her plane
Stares hopeful out the window
At the workers fighting
Through the pouring rain
She's searching through the stations
For an unfamiliar song
And she's pictures all the places
Where she knows she still belongs
And she smiles the secret smile
Because she knows exactly how
To carry on
So run baby run baby run baby run
Baby run
From the old familiar faces and
Their old familiar ways
To the comfort of the strangers
Slipping out before they say
So long
Baby loves to run
Making my way down town
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
It's always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder If you ever think of me
'Cause everything's so wrong
And I don't belong
Living in
Your precious memory
'Cause I need you
And I miss you and now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by oh
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you tonight
And I I don't want to let you know I
I drown in your memory I
I don't want to let this go
I I don't
Making my way down town walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm home bound
Staring blankly ahead
Making my way
Making a way
Through the crowd
And I still need you
And I still miss you
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass us by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you now
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by
'Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you
If I could just hold you tonight
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'd hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me love me like you used to do
If I could turn back time
My world was shattered I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darling then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind
And darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me love me like you used to do oh
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time whoa baby
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me love me like you used to do
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
Then maybe maybe maybe
You'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
You drink your coffee 
I sip my tea 
And we're sitting here playing so cool
Thinking 'What will be will be' 
And it's getting kind of late now 
Oh I wonder if you'll stay now 
Stay now stay now stay now 
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight' 
I move a little closer to you
Not knowing quite what to do and I'm 
Feeling all fingers and thumbs 
I spill my tea oh silly me
It's getting kind of late now 
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now stay now stay now
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight' 
And then we touch much too much
This moment has been waiting for a long long time
Makes me shiver
Makes me quiver
This moment I am so unsure
This moment I have waited for
Well is it something you've been waiting for
Waiting for too 
Take off your eyes 
Bare your soul
Gather me to you and make me whole 
Tell me your secrets 
Sing me the song
Sing it to me in the silent tongue 
It's getting kind of late now 
I wonder if you'll stay now
Stay now stay now stay now
Or will you just politely say 'Goodnight'
Come with me my love
To the sea the sea of love
I wanna tell you just how much I love you
Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you oh how much I love you
Come with me to the sea of love
Do you remember when we met
That's the day I knew you were my pet
I wanna tell you oh how much I love you
Come with me to the sea the sea of love
Your lies won't leave me alone
You used to say you loved me did ya
Why'd you do me this way
It didn't have to be that way
I got your message on the phone
I hung on every single line
You told me what we had was only business
Hurt me so bad I had to sit down with the sickness
Oh yeah
Your lies won't leave me alone
Tore the phone out the wall and it's still ringin'
Wreck the room and curtains ain't hangin' baby
Guitar ain't playin'
Your lies won't leave me alone
Look at your picture in the room I can see you were
Never happy with me baby
All my uncertainty is easy to see
How you're killin' me cause
I got those bills you would not pay
The cost of our love is way too high and I just keep on
Payin' baby
Why'd you say you loved me - walk around and carry on
Hurting 'bout your love is gone the song I sing is sad
And long wonder if you are alone
I don't know if I belong
Your lies won't leave me - alone
Loneliness is the coat you wear
A deep shade of blue is always there
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Baby
Emptiness is the place you're in
Nothing to lose but no more to win
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
When you're without love
Lonely
Without you
Baby
Oh I need you
I can't go on
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The moon ain't gonna rise in the sky
Tears are always clouding your eyes
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
When you're without love
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Not anymore
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Bring it back baby
The sun ain't gonna shine anymore
Oh baby
It's hard to remember how it felt before
Now I found the love of my life
Passes things get more comfortable
Everything is going right
And after all the obstacles
It's good to see you now with someone else
And it's such a miracle that you and me are still good friends
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
We used to think it was impossible
Now you call me by my new last name
Memories seem like so long ago
Time always kills the pain
Remember Harbor Boulevard
The dreaming days where the mess was made
Look how all the kids have grown oh
We have changed but we're still the same
After all that we've been through
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Yeah I know we're cool
And I'll be happy for you
If you can be happy for me
Circles and triangles
And now we're hanging out with your new girlfriend
So far from where we've been
I know we're cool
I know we're cool
See-cool I know we're cool
I know we're cool
Now that Ive lost everything to you
You say you want to start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leaving
Baby I'm grieving
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then a lot of nice things turn bad out there
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child girl
You know Ive seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breaking my heart in two
'Cause I never want to see you sad girl
Don't be a bad girl
But if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware
Beware
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child girl
Baby I love you but if you want to leave take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad
And beware beware
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Oh baby baby it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child girl
There you go
Flashing fever from your eyes
Hey babe come over here and shut them tight
I'm not denying
We're flying above it all
Hold my hand don't let me fall
You've such amazing grace
Ive never felt this way
Oh show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh show me heaven please
Here I go
I'm shaking just like the breeze
Hey babe I need your hand to steady me
I'm not denying
I'm frightened as much as you
Though I'm barely touching you
Ive shivers down my spine
And it feels divine
Oh show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh show me heaven please
If you know what it's like
To dream a dream
Baby hold me tight
And let this be oh
Oh show me heaven
Cover me
Leave me breathless
Oh show me heaven please
Along she came with her picture
Put it in a frame so I won't miss her
Got on a plane from London; Heathrow
It seems such a shame yea
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
Heard she's engaged but to her best friend
No ones to blame here's where it all ends
And I feel the pain 'cause I'm without her
I feel the pain
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I see the sight with a different light
Words cannot describe the way I'm feeling
'Cause Ive been searching in my head
For the words I thought she'd said
For too long
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I feel her. Slipping through my fingers
Now she's gone I'm sleeping with the light on
And sharks swim through my veins now that she's gone
I'm sleeping with the light on
I could be discontent and chase the rainbows end
I might win much more but lose all that is mine
I could be a lot but I know I'm not
I'm content just with the riches that you bring 
I might shoot to win and commit the sin
Of wanting more than Ive already got
I could runaway but I'd rather stay
In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day
the one that makes me say hehe
'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world
You're the best thing that ever happened so don't go away
I might be a king and steal my peoples things
But I don't go for that power crazy way
All that I could rule but I don't check for fools
All that I need is to be left to live my way
say listen what I say
I could chase around for nothing to be found
But why look for something that is never there
I may get it wrong sometimes but I'll come back in style
For I realize your love means more than anything
the song you make me sing yeah
Sitting in my class just drifting away
Staring into the windows of the world
I can't hear the teacher his books don't call me at all
I don't see the bad boys tryin' to catch some play...
'cause I love your smile
I love your smile
The clock at work says three
And I wanna be free
Free to scream free to bathe free to paint
My toes all day
My boss is lame you know and so is the pay
I'm gonna put that new black mini on my charge anyway
'cause I love your smile
I love your smile
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig
I'm showing
The life that I'm living
This is the life that I have
And it's given to you
Yeh'and it's true
La-d-da
Twinkley d
do you
Believe in a girl
like me
Shanice is the one
For you to be with
But when I'm caught
All alone
I start fessing
It's from a state of depression
And the thunder clouds of doubt move in
I begin to wonder Do you still love me
But after that
My whole world is beautiful
Blow branford
Blow
Time came and showed me your direction
Now I know I'll never ever go back
Taught me that
I can be a better girl with love you give
You rock my world
You dig
Smile...Pstch
'cause I love your smile
I love your smile
Take the ribbon from your hair
Shake it loose and let it fall
Layin' soft upon my skin
Like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side
Till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time
Help me make it through the night
I don't care who's right or wrong
I don't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow
Lord tonight I need a friend
Yesterday is dead and gone
And tomorrow's out of sight
And it's sad to be alone
Oh why you look so sad
Tears are in your eyes
Come on and come to me now
Don't be ashamed to cry
Let me see you through
Cause Ive seen the dark side too
When the night falls on you
You don't know what to do
Nothing you confess
Could make me love you less
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
So if you're mad get mad
Don't hold it all inside
Come on and talk to me now
Hey what you got to hide
I get angry too
Well I'm a lot like you
When you're standing at the crossroads
And don't know which path to choose
Let me come along
Cause even if you're wrong
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
And when
When the night falls on you baby
You're feeling all alone
You won't be on your own
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Take me in into your darkest hour
And I'll never desert you
I'll stand by you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Won't let nobody hurt you
I'll stand by you
Mm--Is she really going out with him
Well there she is Let's ask her
Betty is that Jimmy's ring you're wearing
Mm-hm
Gee it must be great riding with him
Is he picking you up after school today
Mm-mm
By the way where did you meet him
I met him at the candy store
He turned around and smiled at me
You get the picture
Yes we see
That's when I fell for the leader of the pack
My folks were always putting him down
They said he came from the wrong side of town
They told me he was bad but I knew he was sad
That's why I fell for the leader of the pack
One day my dad said find someone new
I had to tell my Jimmy we're through
He stood there and asked me why but all I could do was cry
I'm sorry I hurt you the leader of the pack
Do do
He sort of smiled and kissed me good bye
The tears were beginning to show
As he drove away on that rainy night
I begged him to go slow whether he heard
I'll never know Look out! Look out! Look out!
I felt so helpless what could I do
Remembering all the things we'd been through
In school they all stop and stare
I can't hide the tears but I don't care
I'll never forget him the leader of the pack
Ooh the leader of the pack now he's gone
the leader of the pack now he's gone
the leader of the pack now he's gone
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
Heartbeat
Why does a love kiss stay in my memory
Piddly pat
I know that new love thrills me
I know that true love will be
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
Heartbeat
Why do you skip when my babies lips meet mine
Heartbeat
Why do you flip and give me a skip each sign
Piddly pat
And sing to me love's story
And bring to me love's glory
Heartbeat
Why do you miss when my baby kisses me
I feel like I'm dragging you down a one way street 
I don't know which ways up 
All I ask of you is to stay on your feet 
That should be enough 
If we stand around it could pass us by 
We could give up now and never even try
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
I just want something real I can hold onto 
I believe its near 
Life's too short to know the truth 
Maybe it's already hear 
We could throw ourselves into the fire 
We could give up now and never even try
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
We're chasing something we've dreamed of 
is not always out of reach
It's never far away from us 
'cause I believe that
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
To breathe in life and breathe out 
Like tomorrow is today 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
It's not so long to wait 
Breathe in life and breathe out 
Wipe the dust from your sweet smile 
An breathe in life
Oh my love my darling
Ive hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers flow
To the sea to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me wait for me
I'll be coming home wait for me
Oh my love my darling
Ive hungered for your touch
A long lonely time
Time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely mountains gaze
At the stars at the stars
Waiting for the dawn of the day
All alone I gaze
At the stars at the stars
Dreaming of my love far away
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling sadness
I'm losing I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
So save me I'm waiting
I'm needing hear me pleading
And soothe me improve me
I'm grieving I'm barely believing now now
When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying and lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
So use it and prove it
Remove this whirling sadness
I'm losing I'm bluesing
But you can save me from madness now now
When you are flying around and around the world
And I'm lying and lonely
I know there's something sacred and free reserved
And received by me only
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
And you use it only for me
Nobody knows it but you've got a secret smile
Nobody knows it nobody knows it nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it nobody knows it nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it nobody knows it nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it nobody knows it nobody knows it
But you've got a secret
Nobody knows it nobody knows it...
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 
No matter what they call us 
However they attack 
No matter where they take us 
We'll find our own way back 
I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I'll love forever 
I know no matter what 
If only tears were laughter 
If only night was day 
If only prayers were answered 
Then we would hear God say 
No matter what they tell us 
No matter what they do 
No matter what they teach us 
What we believe is true 
And I will keep you safe and strong 
And shelter from the storm 
No matter where it's barren 
A dream is being born 
No matter who they follow 
No matter where they lead 
No matter how they judge us 
I'll be everyone you need 
No matter if the sun don't shine 
Or if the skies are blue 
No matter what the end is 
My life began with you 
I can't deny what I believe 
I can't be what I'm not 
I know I know 
I know this love's forever 
That's all that matters now 
No matter what!
They asked me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find all who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love 
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies smoke gets in your eyes
Smoke gets in your eyes smoke gets in your eyes
Knew the signs
Wasn't right
I was stupid for a while
Swept away by you
And now I feel like a fool
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you
Out of reach so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
Catch myself
From despair
I could drown
If I stay here
Keeping busy everyday
I know I will be OK
But I was
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you
Out of reach so far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
So much hurt
So much pain
Takes a while
To regain
What is lost inside
And I hope that in time
You'll be out of my mind
And I'll be over you
But now I'm
So confused
My heart's bruised
Was I ever loved by you
Out of reach
So far
I never had your heart
Out of reach
Couldn't see
We were never
Meant to be
Out of reach
So far
You never gave your heart
In my reach I can see
There's a life out there
For me
I see trees of green red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day the dark sacred night
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
The colors of the rainbow so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands saying how do you do
They're really saying I love you
I hear babies crying I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll never know
And I think to myself what a wonderful world
Yes I think to myself what a wonderful world
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
An August summer night
Soldiers passing by
Listening to the wind of change
The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
In the wind of change
Walking down the street
Distant memories
Are buried in the past forever
I follow the Moskva
Down to Gorky Park
Listening to the wind of change
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams 
With you and me
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night 
Where the children of tomorrow dream away 
In the wind of change 
The wind of change
Blows straight into the face of time
Like a stormwind that will ring the freedom bell
For peace of mind
Let your balalaika sing
What my guitar wants to say
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow share their dreams
With you and me 
Take me to the magic of the moment
On a glory night
Where the children of tomorrow dream away
In the wind of change 
Say you say me say it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me say it together
Naturally
I had a dream I had an awesome dream
People in the park playing games in the dark
And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out
Say you say me it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me say it together
Naturally
As we go down life's lonesome highway
Seems the hardest thing to do is to find a friend or two
That helping hand
Some one who understands
That when you feel you've lost your way
You've got some one there to say I'll show you
Say you say me it for always
That's the way it should be
Say you say me say it together
Naturally
So you think you know the answers Oh no
Well the whole world has got you dancing
That's right I'm telling you
It's time to start believing oh yes
Believing who you are
You are a shining star
Say you say me it for always
Oh that's the way it should be
Say you say me say it together
Naturally
Say it together naturally
Saying I love you
Is not the words I want to hear from you
It's not that I want you
Not to say but if you only knew
How easy it would be to show me how you feel
More than words is all you have to do to make it real
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
Now that Ive tried to talk to you and make you understand
All you have to do is close your eyes
And just reach out your hands and touch me
Hold me close don't ever let me go
More than words is all I ever needed you to show
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me
Cause I'd already know
What would you do if my heart was torn in two
More than words to show you feel
That your love for me is real
What would you say if I took those words away
Then you couldn't make things new
Just by saying I love you
More than words
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo
They still say I love you
On this you can rely
No matter what the future brings
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
On this you can deny
It's still the same old story
A fight for love and glory
A case of do or die
The world will always welcome lovers
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs
Never out of date
Hearts full of passion
Jealousy and hate
Woman needs man
And man must have his mate
That no one can deny
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by
Girl when you hold me how you control me
You bend and you fold me anyway you please
It must be easy for you the loving things that you do
But just a pastime for you I could never be
And I never know girl 
If I should stay or go
Cos the games that you play 
Keep driving me away
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Kisses and caresses are only minor tests babe
Of love lead to stresses between a woman and a man
So if love everlasting isn't what you're asking
I'll have to pass girl I'm proud to take a stand
I can't continue guessing 
Because it's only messing
With my pride and my mind 
So write down this time to time
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
I'm just a little old-fashioned
It's take more than physical attraction
My initial reaction is honey give me love
Not a facsimile of
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love 
Don't love me for fun girl
Let me be the one girl
Love me for a reason
Let the reason be love
There she goes
There she goes again
Racing through' my brain
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she blows
There she blows again
Pulsing through my vein
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes there she goes again
She calls my name pulls my train
No one else could heal my pain
But I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
There she goes
There she goes again
Chasing down my lane
And I just can't contain
This feeling that remains
Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
Back beat the word was on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one who saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
Today was gonna be the day
But they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you got to do
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do
About you now
And all the roads that we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how
I said maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
You're my wonderwall
I don't want you chew my bread
I don't want you make my bed
I don't want your money too
I just want to make love to you
I don't want you be no slave
I don't want you work all day
I don't want you to be sad or blue
I just want to make love to you
I can tell by the way that you baby talk
I can see by the way that you switch and walk
I can tell by the way that you treat your man
That I could love you baby it's a crying shame
I don't want you wash my clothes
I don't want you clean my home
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you
I don't want you be no slave
I don't want you work all day
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love to you
I don't want you keep a home
I don't want you work a gun
I don't want you to be true
I just want to make love
You can tell the world you never was my girl
You can burn my clothes up when I'm gone
You can tell your friends just what a fool Ive been
And laugh and joke about me on the phone
You can tell my arms go back to the farm
You can tell my feet to hit the floor
Or you can tell my lips to tell my fingertips
They won't be reaching out for you no more
But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
You can tell your mom I moved to Arkansas
You can tell your dog to bite my leg
Or tell your brother Cliff whose fist can tell my lip
He never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise tell anything you please
Myself already knows I'm not OK
Or you can tell my eyes to watch out for my mind
It might be walking out on me today
But don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
Don't tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart
My achy breaky heart
He might blow up and kill this man
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
I can see the first leaf falling
It's all yellow and nice
It's so very cold outside
like the way I'm feeling inside
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
Outside it's now raining
and tears are falling from my eyes
Why did it have to happen
Why did it all have to end
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
I have your arms around me warm like fire
but when I open my eyes
You're gone
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do do feel that
I do do will miss you much
miss you much
I'm a big big girl
in a big big world
It's not a big big thing if you leave me
but I do feel I will miss you much
miss you much
Now if you feel that you can't go on
Because all of your hope is gone
And your life is filled with much confusion
Until happiness is just an illusion
And your world around is crumblin' down
Darling reach out come on girl reach on out for me
Reach out reach out for me
I'll be there with a love that will shelter you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through
When you feel lost and about to give up
Cause your best just ain't good enough
And you feel the world has grown cold
And you're drifting out all on your own
And you need a hand to hold
Darling reach out come on girl reach out for me
Reach out reach out for me
I'll be there to love and comfort you
And I'll be there to cherish and care for you
I'll be there with a love that will see you through
I'll be there to love and comfort you
I can tell the way you hang your head
You're without love and now you're afraid
And through your tears you look around
But there's no peace of mind to be found
I know what you're thinkin'
You're alone now no love of your own
But darling reach out come on girl reach out for me
Reach out
Just look over your shoulder
I'll be there to give you all the love you need
And I'll be there you can always depend on me
I'd really love to be alone without all the
Ache and pain and the April showers
But it ain't long before I long for you like a
Ray of hope coming through the blue moon
When it all gets dark again
The whole thing falls apart I guess
It doesn't really matter about the rain
Cause we'll get through it anyway
We'll get up and start again
Cause we could be lifted lifted lifted
We could be Lifted
From the shadows lifted
Oh we could be lifted up today
Lifted all the way you and I forever
Baby lifted lifted lifted hey
It's undisturbable the peace we found
In a bright new space up above the clouds
Everything is understandable
You don't have to say anything too loud
When all our luck runs out again
We're brought back down to solid ground
I wouldn't say I'm mad about the rain
But we'll get through it anyway
We'll get back to the start again
Cause we could be lifted lifted lifted
We could be lifted
From the shadows lifted
Oh we could be lifted up today
Lifted all the way you and I forever
Baby lifted we could be lifted we could be lifted hey
We could be lifted we could be lifted we could be lifted
You and I forever
We could be lifted we could be lifted yeah we could be lifted
We could be lifted up to new horizons
Lifted lifted up today lifted all the way yeah we could be lifted
We could be lifted from the shadows we could be lifted
Lifted up to new horizons
When it all gets dark again it doesn't really matter about the rain
When it all gets dark again it doesn't really matter about the rain
I'm not proud I was wrong
And the truth is hard to take
I felt sure we had enough
But our love went overboard
Lifeboat lies lost at sea
Ive been trying to reach your shore
Waves of doubt keep drowning me
All the dreams that we were building
We never fulfilled them
Could be better should be better
For lessons in love
For restless eyes egos burn
And the mold is hard to break
Now we've waded in too deep
And love is overboard
Heavy hearts token words
All the hopes I ever had
Fade like footprints in the sand
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it we could use it yeah
Lessons in love
Lost without love
Lessons in love
When will you ever learn
Lessons in love
When there's nowhere left to turn
Lessons in love
Don't let your spirit burn
Lessons in love
I'll wait till you return
All the dreams that we were building
We never lived them
We could lose it we should use it
lessons in love
All the homes that we were building
We never lived in
Could be better should be better
Lessons in love
If we lose the time before us
The future will ignore us
We should use it we could use it 
Lessons in love
It's amazing how you can speak right to my heart
Without saying a word you can light up the dark
Try as I may I could never explain what I hear when you don't say a thing
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
All day long I can hear people talking out loud
but when you hold me near you drown out the crowd
Old Mister Webster could never define
what's being said between your heart and mine
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
The smile on your face lets me know that you need me
There's a truth in your eyes saying you'll never leave me
A touch of your hand says you'll catch me if ever I fall
Now you say it best when you say nothing at all
It's that ole devil called love game
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shock again
Put a ring in my eyes
Tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart
It's that sly ole sun of a gun again
He keeps telling me that I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that ring
Still have those tears
And those rocks in my heart
Suppose I didn't stay and ran away
Wouldn't play
That devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me around
Build me up tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
He'd follow around
Build me up tear me down
Till I'd be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up the fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me
That he's right again
When he sings that siren song
I just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
With that ole devil called love
Let's take a walk together near the ocean shore
Hand in hand you and I
Let's cherish every moment we have been given
For time is passing by
I often pray before I lay down by your side
If you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live 
Cherish the love cherish the life cherish the love
The world is always changing nothing stays the same
But love will stand the test of time
The next life that we live in remains to be seen
Will you be by my side
I often pray before I lay down by your side
And if you receive your calling before I awake
Could I make it through the night
Cherish the love we have
We should cherish the life we live Baby yeah
Cherish the love cherish the life cherish the love
Cherish the love we have
Let's cherish every moment we have together
For as long as we both shall live

Cherish the love cherish the life cherish the love
I had nothing to do on this hot afternoon
But to settle down and write you a line
Ive been meaning to phone you but from Minnesota
Hell it's been a very long time
You wear it well
A little old fashioned but that's all right
Well I suppose you're thinking I bet he's sinking
Or he wouldn't get in touch with me
Oh I ain't begging or losing my head
I sure do want you to know that you wear it well
There ain't a lady in the land so fine
Remember them basement parties your brother's karate
The all day rock and roll shows
Them homesick blues and radical views
Haven't left a mark on you you wear it well
A little out of time but I don't mind
But I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even trying
Now I'm eating my heart out
Trying to get a letter through
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I'm gonna write about the birthday gown that I bought in town
When you sat down and cried on the stairs
You knew it did not cost the earth but for what it's worth
You made me feel a millionaire and you wear it well
Madame Onassis got nothing on you
Anyway my coffee's cold and I'm getting told
That I gotta get back to work
So when the sun goes low and you're home all alone
Think of me and try not to laugh and I wear it well
I don't object if you call collect
Cause I ain't forgetting that you were once mine
But I blew it without even trying
Now I'm eating my heart out trying to get back to you
After all the years I hope it's the same address
Since you've been gone it's hard to carry on
I love you from the bottom of my pencil case
I love you in the songs I write and sing
Love you because you put me in my rightful place
And I love the PRS cheques that you bring
Cheap never cheap
I'll sing you songs till you're asleep
When you've gone upstairs I'll creep
And write it all down down down down
Oh Shirley oh Deborah oh Julie oh Jane
I wrote so many songs about you
I forget your name I forget your name
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I forget your name
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I forget your name
I love your from the bottom of my pencil case
I love the way you never ask me why
I love to write about each wrinkle on your face
And I love you till my fountain pen runs dry
Deep so deep the number one I hope to reap
Depends upon the tears you weep so cry lovey cry cry cry cry
Oh Cathy oh Alison oh Phillipa oh Sue
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
Oh Cathy oh Alison oh Phillipa oh Sue
You made me so much money I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
I wrote this song for you
Jennifer Alison Phillipa Sue Deborah Annabel too
For you for you
I wrote this song for you
I wrote this song for you
I´ve got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it´s cold outside
I´ve got the month of May
Well I guess you´ll say
What can make me feel this way

The bees envy me.

Than the birds in the trees.
Well I guess you´ll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
Ooooh Hoooo
Hey hey hey

Fortune or fame

One man can claim
Well I guess you´ll say
What can make me feel this way
My girl
Talking about my girl
Talking about my girl
I´ve got sushine on cloudy day
With my girl

With my girl
Talking about talking bout my girl

Shadows grow so long before my eyes
And they're moving across the page
Suddenly the day turns into night
Far away from the city
Don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Want to tell you I love your way
Want to be with you night and day
Moon appears to shine and light the sky
With the help of some firefly
Wonder how they have the power to shine shine shine
I can see them under the pine
Don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Want to tell you I love your way
Want to be with you night and day
Well don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
I can see the sunset in your eyes
Brown and gray blue besides
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun
I wish I could buy one
Out of season
Don't hesitate
Cause your love won't wait
Ooh baby I love your way
Want to tell you I love your way
Want to be with you night and day
Just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that were through
I just don't know what to do
I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
Movies only make me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
Cause I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away
Well I don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that were through
I just don't know what to do
Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away
I just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself
We got it together didn't we
We've definitely got our thing together don't we baby
Isn't that nice
I mean really when really sit and think about it
Isn't it really really nice
I can easily feel myself slipping
In more and more ways
That super world of my own
Nobody but you and me
We've got it together baby
My first my last my everything
And the answer to all my dreams
You're my sun my moon my guiding star
My kind of wonderful that's what you are
I know there's only only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
You're you're all I'm living for your love I'll keep forevermore
You're the first you're the last my everything
In you Ive found so many things
A love so new only you could bring
Can't you see it's you You make me feel this way
You're like a fresh morning dew on a brand new day
I see so many ways that I
Can love you till the day I die
You're my reality yet I'm lost in a dream
You're the first the last my everything
I know there's only only one like you
There's no way they could have made two
Girl you're my reality but I'm lost in a dream
You're the first you're the last my everything
You and me baby
It's you and me
And you are the first the last my everything
Thanks for the times that you've given me
The memories are all in mind.
And now that we've come
To the end of our rainbow
There's something I must say out loud!
Your once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you.
Yes your once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
When we are together
The moments I cherish
With every beat of my heart.
To touch you to hold you
To feel you to need you.
There's nothing to keep us apart
You're once twice
Three times a lady
And I love you!
I love you !
I was alone thinking I was just fine
I wasn't looking for anyone to be mine
I thought love was just a fabrication
A train that wouldn't stop at my station
Home alone that was my consignment
Solitary confinement
So when we met I was skirting around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
cause there I stood and I would
Oh I wonder could I say what I felt
And not be misunderstood
A thousand stars came into my system
I never knew how much I had missed them
Slap on my map on my heart you landed
I was coy but you made me candid
And now the planets circle around you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you baby
I didn't know I was looking for love
So we build from here with love the foundation
In a world of tears one consolation
Now you're here there's a full brass band
Playing in me like a wonderland
And if you left I would be two foot small
And every tear would be a waterfall
Soundless boundless I surround you
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I just didn't know
I didn't know I was looking for love until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
I just didn't know
until I found you baby
until I found you
I didn't know I was looking for love
Until I found you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby I don't know why you treating me so bad
You said you love me no one above me
And I was all you had 
And though my heart is eating for you
I can't stop crying
I don't know how I allow you to treat me this way
And still I stay
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby I don't know why you wanna do me wrong 
See when I'm home I'm all alone
And you are always gone
And boy you know I really love you
I can't deny
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears
After all these years
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Oh I trusted you I trusted you
So sad so sad what love will make you do
All the things that we accept
Be the things that we regret
To all of my ladies feel me
Come on sing with me
See when I get the strength to leave
You always tell me that you need me
And I'm weak cause I believe you
And I'm mad because I love you
So I stop and think that maybe
You can learn to appreciate me
Then it all remains the same that
You ain't never gonna change
Never gonna change never gonna change
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
See my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I keep on running back to you
Baby why you hurt me
Leave me and desert me
Boy I gave you all my heart
And all you do is tear it up
Looking out my window
Knowing that I should go
Even when I pack my bags
This something always hold me back
High time we made a stand 
And shook up the views of the common man
And the love train rides from coast to coast
the man we love the most
Could you be could you be squeaky clean and smash every hope of democracy 
As the head line says you're free to choose
There's egg on your face and mud on your shoes
One of these days they're gonna call it the blues yeah yeah
Sowing the seeds of love seeds of love sowing the seeds

Emptiness and just a memory
Love is gone with nothing left for me
All those wasted feeling for something I no longer have
I never knew that love could hurt so bad
Winter melody winter melody winter melody
Play for me just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
I can't bear to see the sun go down
Casting stormy shadows all around
Nothing seems to matter I just get by from day to day
I never thought that you would leave this way
Winter melody winter melody winter melody
Play for me just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
Winter melody
Play for me just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
Loneliness that's all that's left for me
Happiness is chilled by winter's breeze
I keep on remembering the day that you came along
And since you left well I just sing the song
Winter melody winter melody winter melody
Play for me just for me
Cause he's not coming home and I'm here alone
On my own
You do something to me
Something deep inside
I'm hanging on the wire
For a love I'll never find
You do something wonderful
Then chase it all away
Mixing my emotions
That throws me back again
Hanging on the wire yeah
I'm waiting for the change
I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
And feel real again
Hanging on the wire yeah
Said I'm waiting for the change
Oh I'm dancing through the fire
Just to catch a flame
And feel real again
You do something to me
Somewhere deep inside
I'm hoping to get close to
A peace I cannot find 
Dancing through the fire yeah
Just to catch a flame
Just to get close to
Just close enough 
To tell you that
You do something to me
Something deep inside
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you and you'd stay
I don't know why I did the things I did
I don't know why I said the things I said
Love's like a knife it can cut deep inside
Words are like weapons they wound sometimes
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'd hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me love me like you used to do
If I could turn back time
My world was shattered I was torn apart
Like someone took a knife and drove it deep in my heart
You walked out that door I swore that I didn't care
But I lost everything darling then and there
Too strong to tell you I was sorry
Too proud to tell you I was wrong
I know that I was blind
And darling
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that'll hurt you
And you'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give them all to you
Then you'd love me love me like you used to do oh
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time
If I could turn back time whoa baby
I didn't really mean to hurt you
I didn't want to see you go
I know I made you cry but baby
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
I'd take back those words that hurt you
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
Then you'd love me love me like you used to do
If I could turn back time
If I could find a way
Then maybe maybe maybe
You'd stay
If I could reach the stars
I'd give 'em all to you
I'm mad about the boy
And I know it's stupid to be mad about the boy
I'm so ashamed of it but must admit the sleepless nights Ive had
About the boy
On the silverscreen
He melts my foolish heart in every single scene
Although I'm quite aware that here and there are traces of the cad
About the boy
Lord knows I'm not a fool girl
I really shouldn't care
Lord knows I'm not a school girl
Who's in the flurry of her first affair
Will it ever cloy
This odd diversity of misery and joy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy
I'm feeling quite insane and young again
And all because I'm mad about the boy
I remember when I remember I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions have an echo
In so much space
And when you are out there
Without care
Yeah I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Does that make me crazy
Probably 
And I hope you are having the time of you are life - Think twice - that's my only advice
Com on now comn on now come on now whw do you think you are
Ha ha ha bless your soul
You really think you are in control
Well I think you are crazy
I think you are crazy
I think you are crazy
Just like me
My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little ever since I was little it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence Ive come
And I can die when I'm done
But Maybe I am crazy
Maybe you are crazy
Maybe we are crazy
Probably
Uh uh
Pretty women out walking with gorillas down my street
From my window I'm staring while my coffee grows cold
Look over there! Where
There's a lady that I used to know
She's married now or engaged or something so I am told
Is she really going out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really going out with him
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here 
Tonight's the night when I go to all the parties down my street
I wash my hair and I kid myself I look real smooth
Look over there! Where
Here comes Jeanie with her new boyfriend
They say that looks don't count for much
If so there goes your proof
Is she really going out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really going out with him
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here 
But if looks could kill
There's a man there who's more down as dead
Cause Ive had my fill
Listen you take your hands off her head
I get so mean around this scene
Is she really going out with him
Is she really gonna take him home tonight
Is she really going out with him
Cause if my eyes don't deceive me
There's something going wrong around here
You look into my eyes I go out of my mind
I can't see anything coz this love got me blind
I can't help myself I can't break the spell
I'm in over my head
You got under my skin
I got no strength at all
In the state that I'm in
And my knees are weak
And my mouth can't speak
Fell to far this time
Baby I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep I can't sleep I can't think
I just think about the things you do
I'm just too lost in you
Well you whisper to me
And I shiver inside
You undo me and move me in ways undefined
And you are all I see
And you are all I need
Help me baby help me now
Cause I'm slipping away
Like the sand to the tide
Flowing into your arms falling into your eyes
If you get too near I might disappear
I might loose my mind
Baby I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep I can't sleep I can't think
I just think about the things you do
I'm just too lost in you
I'm going crazy with love for you baby
I can't eat and I can't sleep
I'm going down like a stone in the sea
No one can rescue me
Baby I'm too lost in you
Caught in you
Lost in everything about you
So deep I can't sleep I can't think
I just think about the things you do
I'm just too lost in you
You look into my eyes I go out of my mind
I'm too lost in you I'm too lost in you
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
I just needed you to comfort me
And I have tried to make it right
And I don't know that I feel so sure
But I think that we missed out
So Ive sung this song for you
And I just want you to say to me
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
And all I wanted was to stand alone
So is there a place that we could meet
And you see this face within your face and I
Stayed away but I'm back to hear you say
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
In the Heavens above
Can you hear me
Through the spaces
Wondering in this wonderland
And if I try to understand
This broken man broken man
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
In the Heavens above
Broken man
Don't worry cause I'll always be there for you
Always be there
Broken man
In the Heavens in the Heavens
In the Heavens for you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
I put a spell on you because you are mine
You better stop the things that you do
I ain't lying no I ain't lying
I just can't stand it babe
The way you're always running around
I just can't stand it the way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine
I put a spell on you because you're mine
You better stop the things that you do
I ain't lying no I ain't lying
I just can't stand it babe
The way you're always running around
I just can't stand it the way you always put me down
I put a spell on you because you're mine
I put a spell on you. I put a spell on you
I put a spell on you. I put a spell on you
Think about it there must be higher love
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above
Without it life is a wasted time
Look inside your heart I'll look inside mine
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear and standing out there alone
A yearning and it's real to me
There must be someone who's feeling for me
Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world what is fair
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring be a higher love
I could rise above on a higher love
I will wait for it
I'm not too late for it
Until then I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel that love come over me
Let me feel how strong it could be
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's that higher love I keep thinking of
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh
Bring me a higher love oh
Bring me a higher love oh 
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love oh oh
I said bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love oh
bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love oh yeah 
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love 
Bring me a higher love
Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world where few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
When it's real
I keep it alive
The road is long
There are mountains in the way
But we climb a step every day
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles cry
On a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world we know
Up where the clear winds blow
Some hang on to used to be
Live their lives looking behind
When all we have is here and now
All our lives
Out there to find
The road is long
There are mountains in the way
But we climb a step every day
Time goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive today
All I know 
Is everything is not as it seems
But the more I grow the less I know
And I have lived so many lives
Though I'm not old
And the more I see the less I grow
The fewer the seeds the more I sow
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Try
I wish I hadn't seen all of the realness
And all the real people are really not real at all
The more I learn the more I learned
The more I cry the more I cried
As I say goodbye to the way of life
I thought I had designed for me
Then I see you standing there
Wanting more from me
And all I can do is try
Then I see you standing there
I'm all I'll ever be
And all I can do is try
Try
All of the moments that already passed already passed
We'll try to go back and make them last
All of the things we want each other to be
We never will be we never will be
And that's wonderful that's life
That's you baby
This is me baby 
We are we are we are we are we are we are
Free
In our love 
We are free in our love
I shouldn't be alone with you tonight
Desire was too strong to put up a fight
I don't understand the way I feel although it feels so right
I really shouldn't be here tonight
In your eyes there's a sign of intensity
I sense an atmosphere 
No need to hide from the way that you feel inside
There's nothing left to fear
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
Your on my mind all of the time
I really shouldn't stay with you tonight 
But the more and more I think of it
The more it just seems right
I really shouldn't be here tonite
Now I find I don't know who I really am 
I'm lost without a trace
So take me high take me low 
Anyhow you know
And help me if you can
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
Why I don't know I'm into deep to say no
Hold me close don't let me go
I want to take this chance 
Risk it all for you
Its what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want to take this chance risk it all for you
Knowing what I'm gonna do
If only for tonight Don't be a stranger
I want it all from you tonight
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes each one she passes goes 
When she walks she's like a samba
That swings so cool and sways so gentle that
When she passes each one she passes goes
But I watch her so sadly
How can I tell her I love you
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking and
When she passes I smile but she doesn't see doesn't see
Olha que coisa mais linda mais cheia de graça
ela menina que vem e que passa
Num doce balanço a caminho do mar
Moça do corpo dourado do sol de ipanema
O seu balançado mais que um poema
a coisa mais linda que eu já vi passar
But I watch her so sadly
Porque tudo to triste
Yes I would give my heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at me
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from ipanema goes walking
And when she passes I smile but she doesn't see
Por causa do amor
She just doesn't see
Nem olha para mim
She never sees me
Por causa do amor
Touch me in the morning
Then just walk away
We don't have tomorrow
But we had yesterday
Wasn't it me who said that
Nothing good's gonna last forever
And wasn't it me who said
Let's just be glad for the time together
It must've been hard to tell me
That you've given all you had to give
I can understand you're feeling that way
Everybody's got their life to live
Well I can say goodbye in the cold morning light
But I can't watch love die in the warmth of the night
If Ive got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone
'Till you go I need to lie here and think about
The last time that you'll touch me in the morning
Then just close the door
Leave me as you found me empty like before
Wasn't it yesterday
We used to laugh at the wind behind us
Didn't we run away and hope
That time wouldn't try to find us 
Didn't we take each other
To a place where no one's ever been
Yeah I really need you near me tonight
Cause you'll never take me there again
Let me watch you go
With the sun in my eyes
We've seen how love can grow
Now we'll see how it dies
If Ive got to be strong
Don't you know I need to have tonight when you're gone
Till you go I need to hold you until the time
Your hands reach out and touch me in the morning
Mornings where blue and gold and we could feel one another living
Then just walk away
We walked with a dream to hold and we could take what the world was giving
We don't have tomorrow
There's no tomorrow here there's only love and the time to chase it
But we had yesterday
But yesterday's gone my love there's only now and it's time to face it
Touch me in the morning
I sit by the harbor
The sea calls to me
I hide in the water
But I need to breath
You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away
Ive been run a ground
So sad for a sailor
I felt safe and sound
But needed the danger
You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away
You are an ocean wave my love
Crashing at the bow
I am a galley slave my Love
If only I could find out the way to sail you
Maybe I'll just stow away
Stow away
Stow away
I am not in love 
But I'm open to persuasion 
East or West 
Where's the best 
For romancing
With a friend 
I can smile 
But with a lover 
I could hold my head back 
I could really laugh 
Really laugh
Thank you 
You took me dancing 
Cross the floor 
Cheek to cheek 
But with a lover 
I could really move 
Really move 
I could really dance 
Really dance 
Really dance 
Really dance 
I could really move 
Really move 
Really move 
Really move
Now if I can feel the sun 
In my eyes 
And the rain on my face 
Why can't I 
Feel love
I can really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Really love 
Love love love love 
Love love love love
Now I got all 
The friends that I want 
I may need more 
But I shall just stick to those 
That I have got 
With friends I still feel 
So insecure
Little darling I believe you could 
Help me a lot 
Just take my hand 
And lead me where you will 
No conversation 
No wave goodnight 
Just make love 
With affection
Sing me another love song 
But this time 
With a little dedication 
Sing it sing it 
You know that's what I like 
Once more with feeling 
Give me love 
Give me love 
Give me love 
Love
She's passing this way
And if you're looking for love she'll give it away
Yeah we've all drunk from that cup
You'll be hooked within minutes of tasting a drop
Cause she is something that is true
But just a kiss my friend you're through
Cause when she walks and leaves you blue
You'll look like the junkies standing here in front of you
But hey you should follow your heart
Maybe she won't desire for just pulling apart
And I don't care if she does
Once she's got you in deeper there'll be one more of us
Cause she is something that is true
But just a kiss my friend you're through
Cause when she walks and leaves you blue
You'll look like the junkies standing here in front of you
The look of love
Is in your eyes
A look your smile 
Can't disguise
The look of love
Is saying so much more than
Just words could every say
And what my heart has heard
Well it takes my breath away
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
You've got the look of love
Is on your face
A look that time can't erase
Be mine tonight
Let this be just the start of 
So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
I love you so
I can hardly wait to hold you
Feel my arms around you
How long I have waited
Waited just to love you
Now that I have found you
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
Don't ever go
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around you'll 
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day 
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name and I'll be there
A world filled with love is a wonderful sight
Being in love is what's heart's delight
But that look of love isn't on my face
That enchanted feeling has been replaced
As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know Ive got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe
The fruits of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumbling down
Everyday heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer
I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone who care
Always moving and going nowhere
What becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know Ive got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me please
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look
There's a growing need
Oh he is lost there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending
Now what becomes of the broken hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know Ive got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
I'll be searching everywhere
Just to find someone to care
I'll be looking everyday
I know Ive got to find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow
I'll be searching everywhere
Sometimes when I'm down and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hanging on
Oh honey all I ever need is you
You're my first love you're my last
You're my future you're my past
And loving you is all I ask honey
All I ever need is you
Winters come and they go and we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring all the things you do
Give me a reason to build my world around you
Some men follow rainbows I am told
Some men search for silver some for gold
I have found my treasure in your soul honey
All I ever need is you
Without love I'd never find the way
Through ups and downs of every single day
I won't sleep at night until you say my honey
All I ever need is you
Sometimes I feel Ive got to
Run away Ive got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And Ive lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
Once I ran to you 
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love 
Tainted love
Now I know Ive got to
Run away Ive got to
Get away you don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
Once I ran to you 
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love 
Tainted love
Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Touch me baby tainted love
Touch me baby tainted love
Tainted love 
Tainted love 
Tainted love
Tainted love
I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because
I call you up
Don't get me wrong don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love no no it's because
I like to see you
But then again
That doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you
Don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love no no it's because
I keep your picture
Upon the wall
It hides a nasty stain that's lying there
So don't you ask me
To give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love no no it's because
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
Ooh you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh you'll wait a long time
I'm not in love
So don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
Love love changes everything 
Hands and faces earth and sky 
Love love changes everything 
How you live and how you die 
Love can make the summer fly 
Or a night seem like a lifetime 
Yes love love changes everything 
Now I tremble at your name 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 
Love love changes everything 
Days are longer words mean more 
Love love changes everything 
Pain is deeper than before 
Love will turn your world around 
And that world will last forever 
Yes love love changes everything 
Brings you glory brings you shame 
Nothing in the world will ever be the same 
Off into the world we go 
Planning futures shaping years 
Love and suddenly all our wisdom disappears 
Love makes fools of everyone 
All the rules we made are broken 
Yes love love changes everyone 
Live or perish in its flame 
Love will never never let you be the same 
Love will never never let you be the same 
With every look with every touch
With every kiss you're in my heart
With every move with every prayer
With every beat you're in my heart
Like a drum my heart beats like a drum
As my mind begins to run
Back to you
Every movie that I see
The face upon the screen
It's you
With every look with every touch
With every kiss you're in my heart
With every move with every prayer
With every beat you're in my heart
In my room your perfume fills the are
The shirt you used to wear
It's still there
In a room with so called friends
I here your voice again
Its you
With every look with every touch
With every kiss you're in my heart
With every move with every prayer
With every beat you're in my heart
And in my heart there's a photograph of you
For all the world to see
And in my heart there's a picture of you
Walking away from me
With every look with every touch
With every kiss you're in my heart
With every move with every prayer
With every beat you're in my heart
With every look with every touch
With every kiss you're in my heart
With every move with every prayer
With every beat you're in my heart
Just smile for me and let the day begin
You are the sunshine that lights my heat within
I'm sure that you're an angel in disguise
Come take my hand and together we will rise
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high Upon the wings of love
You look at me and I begin to melt
Just like the snow when a ray of sun is felt
I'm crazy bout ya baby can't you see
I'd be delighted if you could come with me
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Flying high Upon the wings of love
Yes you belong to me
I'm yours exclusively
Right now we live and breathe Each other
Inseparable it seems
We're flowing like a stream
Running free flowing
On the wings of love
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Together flying high
On the wings of love
Up and above the clouds
The only way to fly
Is on the wings of love
On the wings of love
Only the two of us
Together flying high
Together flying high
Upon the wings of love
I'm 15 for a moment
Caught in between 10 and 20
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are 
I'm 22 for a moment
She feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars 
15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
15 there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live 
I'm 33 for a moment
Still the man but you see I'm a they
A kid on the way they
A family on my mind 
I'm 45 for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life 
15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose yourself
Within a morning star
15 I'm all right with you
15 there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live 
Half time goes by
Suddenly youre wise
Another blink of an eye
67 is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on
I'm 99 for a moment
Dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are 
15 there's still time for you
22 I feel her her too
33 you're on your way
Every day's a new day
15 there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose
15 there's never a wish better than this
When you only got 100 years to live 
Debbie just hit the wall
She never had it all 
One Prozac a day
Husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door
When she turned twentyfour 
Only been with one man
What happened to her plan
She was gonna be an actress
She was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass
On the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life
And nothing has been alright since
Bruce Springsteen Madonna
Way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie
And music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school
They tell her that she's uncool 
'Cause she's still preoccupied
With 19 19 1985
She's seen all the classics
She knows every line
Breakfast Club Pretty in Pink
Even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham 
Not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand
On a member of Duran Duran
Where's the miniskirt made of snake skin
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen
When did reality become TV
What ever happen to sitcoms game shows 
She hates time make it stop
When did Motley Crew become classic rock
And when did Ozzy become an actor
Please make this stop
Stop
And bring back
Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it we can achieve it
Come a little bit closer baby
Get it on get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
Set your spirit free It is the only way to be
Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out boy let's work it out boy
Any deal that we endeavour
Boys and girls feel good together
Take it or leave it take it or leave it
Are you as good as I remember baby
Get it on get it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
Set your spirit free It is the only way to be
Be a little wiser baby put it on put it on
'Cause tonight is the night when two become one
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
Set your spirit free It is the only way to be
It is the only way to be
It is the only way to be
Hey baby I ain't  much of you 
No no no no no no no no baby
I ain't  much of you 
Just a biga biga hunk o' biga love will do 
Don't be a stingy little mama 
You're about to starve me half to death 
Well you can spare a kiss or two and 
still have plenty left
Hey baby I ain't  much of you 
Well just a biga biga biga hunk o' love will do 
You're just a natural born beehive 
Filled with honey to the top 
I ain't greedy baby 
All I want is all you got
Baby I ain't  much of you 
Well just a biga biga biga hunk o' love will do will do
I got wishbone in my pocket 
Got a rabbIt is foot 'round my wrist 
I'd have all the things these lucky charms could bring 
If you'd give me just one sweet kiss no no no no no no no 
Baby ain't  much of you 
Well just a biga biga biga hunk o' love will do will do
Just a biga biga biga hunk o' love will do will do
Just a biga biga biga hunk o' love will do will do
Thank you
Thank you very much
I heat up I can't cool down
You got me spinning
'Round and 'round
'Round and 'round and 'round it goes
Where it stops nobody knows
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burning flame
burning flame full of desire
Kiss me baby let the fire get higher
Abraabracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abraabracadabra
Abracadabra
You make me hot you make me sigh
You make me laugh you make me cry
Keep me burning for your love
With the touch of a velvet glove
Abraabracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abraabracadabra
Abracadabra
I feel the magic in your caress
I feel magic when I touch your dress
Silk and satin leather and lace
Black panties with an angel's face
I see magic in your eyes
I hear the magic in your sighs
Just when I think I'm gonna get away
I hear those words that you always say
Abraabracadabra
I want to reach out and grab ya
Abraabracadabra
Abracadabra
Every time you call my name
I heat up like a burning flame
burning flame full of desire
Kiss me baby let the fire get higher
I heat up I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
I heat up I can't cool down
My situation goes 'round and 'round
She loved him like he was
The last man on Earth
Gave him everything she ever had
He'd break her spirit down
Then come loving up to her
Give a little then take it back
She'd tell him about her dreams
He'd just shoot 'em down
Lord he loved to make her cry
You're crazy for believing
You'll ever leave the ground
He said Only angels know how to fly
And with a broken wing
She still sings
She keeps an eye on the sky
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly
One Sunday morning
She didn't go to church
He wondered why she didn't leave
He went up to the bedroom
Found a note by the window
With the curtains blowing in the breeze
With a broken wing
She carries her dreams
Man you ought to see her fly
So she said what's the problem baby
What's the problem I don't know 
Well maybe I'm in love love
Think about it every time
I think about it
Can't stop thinking about it
How much longer will it take to cure this
Just to cure it cause I can't ignore it if It is love love 
Makes me wanna turn around and face me but I don't know nothing about love 
Come on come on 
Turn a little faster
Come on come on 
The world will follow after
Come on come on 
Cause everybody's after love
So I said I'm a snowball running 
Running down into the spring that's coming
All this love 
Melting under blue skies 
Belting out sunlight 
Shimmering love 
Well baby I surrender 
To the strawberry ice cream
Never ever end of all this love
Well I didn't mean to do it 
But there's no escaping your love
These lines of lightning 
Mean we're never alone 
Never alone no no 
Come on Come on
Move a little closer 
Come on Come on
I want to hear you whisper
Come on Come on 
Settle down inside my love
Jump jump 
Jump a little higher
Come on come on
If you feel a little lighter
Come on come on 
We were once
Upon a time in love 
We're accidentally in love 
Accidentally in love
Accidentally 
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
Accidentally in love
I'm In Love I'm in Love 
I'm in Love I'm in Love 
I'm in Love I'm in Love
Accidentally
Come on come on
Spin a little tighter
Come on come on 
And the world's a little brighter
Come on come on 
Just get yourself inside her 
Love I'm in love
You can tell the world 
you never was my girl 
you can burn my clothes
up when I'm gone
You can tell your friends 
just what a fool I've been
and laugh and joke 
about me on the phone
You can tell my arms
Go back into the farm!
You can tell my feet 
to hit the floor
You can tell my lips 
to tell my fingertips
they won't be reaching out
for you no more
But don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart 
my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man 
You can tell your Ma 
I moved to Arkansas
you can tell your dog
to bite my leg 
Or tell your brother Cliff 
whose fist can tell my lips
he never really liked me anyway
Or tell your Aunt Louise
tell anything you please
myself already knows I'm not OK
Or you can tell my eyes
to watch out for my mind
it might be walkin' out 
on me one day
But don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
And if you tell my heart 
my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man 
But don't tell my heart
my achy breaky heart
I just don't think he'd understand
But if you tell my heart 
my achy breaky heart
he might blow up and kill this man

Well here we are again 
I guess it must be fate  
We have tried it on our own  
But deep inside We have known  
We'd be back to set things straight   
I still remember when  
Your kiss was so brand new  
Every memory s  
Every step I take retreats  
Every journey always brings me back to you   
After all the stops and starts  
We keep coming back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that We have been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess It is meant to be  
Forever you and me after All   
When love is truly right  
This time It is truly right  
It lives from year to year  
It changes as it goes  
Oh and on the way it grows  
But it never disappears   
After all the stops and starts  
We keep coming back to these two hearts  
Two angels who've been rescued from the fall  
After all that We have been through  
It all comes down to me and you  
I guess It is meant to be  
Forever you and me after All   
Always just beyond my touch  
You know I needed you so much  
After all what else is livin' for  
I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It is like I'm lifted out of time
And time again
Patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me and pulled me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade
I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all I will ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
It is like I'm drifting out of time
Alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes
I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It is like I'm lifted out of time
And time again
Patiently I've waited
For this moment to arrive
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me and pulled me closer
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade
I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all I will ever need
With ev'ry kiss from your sweet lips
It is like I'm drifting out of time
Alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes
When I'm feeling blue all I have to do 
Is take a look at you then I'm not so blue 
When you're close to me I can feel your heart beat 
I can hear you breathing in my ear 
Wouldn't you agree baby you and me 
We have got a groovy kind of love 
Anytime you want to you can turn me on to 
Anything you want to anytime at all 
When I kiss your lips ooh I start to shiver 
Can't control the quivering inside 
Wouldn't you agree baby you and me 
 got a groovy kind of love 
When I'm feeling blue all I have to do 
Is take a look at you then I'm not so blue 
When I'm in your arms nothing seems to matter 
My whole world could shatter I don't care 
Wouldn't you agree baby you and me 
 got a groovy kind of love 
 We have got a groovy kind of love
 We have got a groovy kind of love
 We have got a groovy kind of love
It is a kind of magic
It is a kind of magic
A kind of magic
One dream one soul one prize one goal
One golden glance of what should be
It is a kind of magic
One flash of light that shows the way
No mortal man can win this day
It is a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
It is a challenging the doors of time
It is a kind of magic
The waiting seems eternity
The day will dawn of sanity
Is this a kind of magic
It is a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
will soon be gone
This flame that burns inside of me
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It is a kind of magic
The bell that rings inside your mind
It is challenging the doors of time
It is a kind of magic
It is a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
will soon be will soon be
will soon be gone
This is a kind of magic
There can be only one
This rage that lasts a thousand years
will soon be gone
Gone
Magic
It is a kind of magic
It is a kind of magic
Magic magic magic
Ah ha It is magic
Ah ha
It is a kind of magic
This rage that lasts a thousand years
will soon be gone
Yeah
This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With Mr Einstein's theory 
So we must get down to earth at times 
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed
You must remember this 
A kiss is just a kiss a sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo 
They still say I love you 
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny
It is still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
Oh yes the world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
It is still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by

Don't wanna argue don't wanna fight
Don't want no politics babe all thru the night
I told ya before  gonna tell ya once more
For the last time baby open up your door
All I want is you all I want is you
Not any old girl will do
All I want is you
If ya don't need love ya gotta be nuts
The heaviest metal always rusts
Just you and me babe hangin' tough
It is gotta be It is gotta be It is gotta be love or bust
Don't need a doctor don't need a nurse
Don't need a prescription babe

Don't need a license don't need insurance
Don't need a ticket where we're going babe
You got my assurance ya

For the last time baby open up your door
I will watch you in the darkness
Show you love will see you through
When the bad dreams wake you crying
I will show you all love can do
All love can do
I will watch by the night
Hold you in my arms
Give you dreams where no one will be
I will watch through the dark
Till the morning comes
For the lights will take you
Through the night to see
All love showing us all love can be
I will guard you with my bright wings
Stay till your heart learns to see
All love can be
Baby baby baby baby baby
Baby Ooh I'm so glad
I will never find another lover
sweeter than you sweeter than you
I will never find another lover
more precious than you more precious than you
Girl you are
Close to me like my mother
Close to me like my father 
Close to me like my sister 
Close to me like my brother
You are the only one my everything
and for you this song I sing
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you 
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too
Said I promise to never fall in love with a stranger 
You're all I'm thinking of
I praise the Lord above 
For sending me your love I cherish every hug
I REALLY LOVE YOU!!!
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you 
And I hope that you feel the same way too
Yes I pray that you do love me too
You're all that I've ever known 
When you smile on your face all I see is a glow 
You turned my life around
You picked me up when I was down 
You're all that I've ever known
when you smile your face glows 
You picked me up when I was down 
You're all that I've ever known
when you smile your face glows 
You picked me up when I was down and
I hope that you feel the same way too 
Yes I pray that you do love me too
All my life I prayed for someone like you
And I thank God that I that I finally found you
All my life I prayed for someone like you 
Yes I pray that you do love me too
I've never had this feeling before 
I've never wanted anyone more 
And something in your eyes tells me 
You feel the way that I do 
I feel like you do 
If you would like to stay here all night 
You know that I would say 
It is all right 
Though I'm saying yes 
I confess 
I've got more on my mind 
'Cause I want more of you 
Than your time 
All of you your body and soul 
Every kind of love you can express 
All the secret dreams you've never told 
I want everything 
And I will take nothing less 
All of you as long as you live 
Everything you've never shared before 
I want all of you that you can give 
All your joys and all your sorrows 
Your todays and your tomorrows 
How I long to feel the warmth of your touch 
And then if I'm not  too much 
I'd like to spend my life wand'ring through 
All the wonders of you 
And when we're lying close in the dark 
So close I feel each beat of your heart 
I want you to reveal what you feel 
All you hold deep inside 
There is nothing I want you to hide 
All of you your body and soul 
Everything you want this love to be 
I want all of you 
All that you can give 
And in return for all your giving 
Let me give you all of me 
All of you your body and soul 
Every kind of love you can express 
All the secret dreams you've never told 
I want everything everything everything 
All of you as long as you live
As long as you live 
Everything you want this love to be 
I want all of you 
All that you can give 
In return in return I wanna give you 
Let me give you
I know I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try
Find a reason why
You should pick it up
And try it again
'Cause It is all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It is all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It is all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
'Cause It is not too late for that
Too late for me love
I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different
And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that It is true
And I hear you say It is all right
Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us
The past behind us
Then we're on our way
Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes
You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
You should kick it up
And try it again 
I know I know what's on your mind
And I know it gets tough sometimes
But you can give it one more try
Find a reason why
You should pick it up
And try it again
'Cause It is all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out this time
It is all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might work out fine this time
It is all right
I think we're gonna make it
I think it might just work out
'Cause It is not too late for that
Too late for me love
I know I've been hurt before
And I know I really shouldn't give any more
But this time
This time things seem just a little different
And when I look in your eyes
You know I can see that It is true
And I hear you say It is all right
Just when you feel helpless
Nothing left to say
Love will find us
The past behind us
Then we're on our way
Time and time again I see
People so unsure like me
We all know it gets hard sometimes
You can give it one more try
Find another reason why
You should pick it up
You should kick it up
And try it again 
I thought that dreams belonged to other men
'Cause each time I got close
They'd fall apart again
I feared my heart would beat in secrecy
I faced the nights alone
Oh how could I have known
That all my life I only needed you
Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
It seems like perfect love's so hard to find
I'd almost given up
You must have read my mind
And all these dreams I saved for a rainy day
They're finally coming true
I will share them all with you
'Cause now we hold the future in our hands
Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
And in your arms salvation's not so far away
It is getting closer
Closer every day
It is almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
Whoa
Almost paradise
We're knockin' on heaven's door
Almost paradise
How could we ask for more
I swear that I can see forever in your eyes
Paradise
Paradise
Paradise

Every time our eyes meet
This feeling inside me
Is almost more than I can take
Baby when you touch me
I can feel how much you love me
And it just blows me away
I've never been this close to anyone or anything
I can hear your thoughts
I can see your dreams
I don't know how you do what you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
The smell of your skin
The taste of your kiss
The way you whisper in the dark
Your hair all around me
Baby you surround me
You touch every place in my heart
Oh it feels like the first time every time
I wanna spent the whole night in your eyes
Every little thing that you do
I'm so in love with you
It just keeps getting better
I wanna spend the rest of my life
With you by my side
Forever and ever
Every little thing that you do
Oh every little thing that you do
Baby I'm amazed by you
What if I told you it was all meant to be 
Would you believe me Would you agree 
It is almost that feeling that We have met before 
So tell me that you don't think I'm crazy 
when I tell you love has come here and now 
A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this 
Some people search forever for that one special kiss
Oh I can't believe It is happening to me 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this 
Everything changes but beauty remains 
Something so tender I can't explain 
I may be dreaming but until I awake 
Can't we make this dream last forever 
And I will cherish all the love we share
A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this 
Some people search forever for that one special kiss 
Oh I can't believe It is happening to me 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this 
Could this be the greatest love of all 
I wanna know that you will catch me when I fall 
So let me tell you this 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this 
A moment like this 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this 
Some people search forever for that one special kiss 
Oh I can't believe It is happening to me 
Some people wait a lifetime for a moment a moment like this 
Oh I can't believe It is happening to me
some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this
I give her all my love 
That's all I do 
And if you saw my love 
You'd love her too 
I love her 
She gives me ev'rything 
And tenderly 
The kiss my lover brings 
She brings to me 
And I love her 
A love like ours 
Could never die 
As long as I 
Have you near me 
Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine 
Will never die 
And I love her 
Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine 
Will never die 
And I love her
And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived 'til now
I tell them I don't know
I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand
And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me 
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirit free
I'm happy that you do
The book of life is brief
And once a page is read
All but life is dead
That is my belief
And yes I know how lonely life can be
The shadows follow me 
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me
 It is been five months since you went away
Left without a word and nothing to say
When I was the one who gave you my heart and soul
But it wasn't good enough for you no
So I asked God
God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel 
To wipe the tears from my eyes
And I know it might sound crazy
But after all that I still love you
You wanna come back in my life
But now there is something I have to do
I have to tell the one that I once adored
That they can't have my love no more
Cause my heart can't take no more lies
And my eyes are all out of cries
God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel 
To wipe the tears from my eyes
Now you have me on my knees 
Begging God please to send you back to me
I couldn't eat I couldn't sleep
You made me feel like I could not breathe
Now all I wanted to do was to feel your touch
And give you all my love
But you took my love for granted
Want my loving now
But you can't have it
God
God send me an angel
From the heavens above
Send me an angel to heal my broken heart
From being in love
'Cause all I do is cry
God send me an angel 
To wipe the tears from my eyes
Oh God send me God send me an angel
An angel wipe the tears from my eyes Oh baby
Send me an angel from the heavens above
Send me an angel God send me an angel
From being in love send me an angel
Oh God send me an angel
Send me an angel send me an angel
Ooohhhh
Since you been gone
I been hangin' around here lately
With my mind messed up
Jumped in my car tried to clear my mind
Didn't help me
I guess I'm all messed up now baby
Soon as I jumped into my ride
Those memories start to play
A song comes on the radio
And there you are baby once again
It is just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And It is all because of you
Since you been gone
I keep thinkin' about you baby
Gets me all choked up
This heart of mine keeps
Dreamin' of you and It is crazy
You'd think I'd had enough
As soon as I get you out my head
I'm in your car again
Just one request from the radio
I'm back in love sugar once again
It is just another sad love song
Rackin' my brain like crazy
Guess I'm all torn up
Be it fast or slow
It doesn't let go
Or shake me
And It is all because of you
Here comes the strings
Then somebody sings
Only takes a beat
And then it starts killin' me darlin'
Only takes one note I tell ya
From that radio
It is just
Another
Lonely
Love song
I can't remember why we fell apart 
From something that was so meant to be 
Forever was the promise in our hearts 
Now more and more I wonder where you are 
Do I ever cross your mind  anytime 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me 
Do I ever cross your mind  anytime 
I miss you 
Still have your picture in the frame 
Hear your footsteps down the hall 
I swear I hear your voice driving me insane 
How I wish that you would call to say  
Do I ever cross your mind  anytime 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me 
Do I ever cross your mind  anytime 
I miss you I miss you 
No more loneliness and heartache 
No more crying myself to sleep 
No more wondering about tomorrow 
Won't you come back to me 
Come back to me 
Oh ho oh 
Do I ever cross your mind  anytime 
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me 
Do I ever cross your mind  anytime 
I miss you 
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She loves to laugh
She loves to sing
She does everything
She loves to move
She loves to grove
She loves the loving things
Ooh all night all night
Oh every night
So hold tight hold tight
Ooh baby hold tight
Oh she said
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
I was alone
I never knew
What good love could do
Ooh then we touched
Then we sang
About the loving things
Ooh all night all night
Oh every night
So hold tight hold tight
Ooh baby hold tight
Oh she said
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
Oh she said any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it  
She said hoooold on
Hold on hold on hoooold on
She said
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
She said
Any way you want it
That's the way you need it
Any way you want it
If a picture paints a thousand words 
then why can't I paint you  
The words would never show  
the you I've come to know      
If a face could launch a thousand ships  
then where am I to go  
There's no one home but you  
you're all that's left me to      
And when my love for life   
is running dry  
You come and pour   
yourself on me      
If a man could be two places at one time  
I'd be with you   
tomorrow and today  
beside you all the way      
If the world should stop revolving  
Spinning slowly down to die  
I'd spend the end with you   
when the world was through      
Then one by one   
the stars would all go out     
Then you and I   
would simply fly away!  
If a Picture Paints a Thousand Words
Are you lonesome tonight
do you miss me tonight
Are you sorry we drifted apart
Does your memory stray to a bright sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight
Spoken
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love 
with you as my sweet heart
Act one was when we met I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I never knew
Honey you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
Is your heart filled with pain shall I come back again
Tell me dear are you lonesome tonight
Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine
I'm leaving my life in your hands
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance
How you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is written in you history
As long as you're here with me
I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me
Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me
Every little thing that you have said and done
Feels like It is deep within me
Doesn't really matter if you're on the run
It seems like we're meant to be
I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes
What you did and where you're comin from
I don't care as long as you love me baby
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I'm under pressure seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now don't know girl we both know what to do
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me we could be starving
We could be homeless we could be broke
As long as you love me I will be your platinum I will be your silver I will be your gold
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you lololololololove me
I will be your soldier fighting every second of the day for the change girl
I will be your Hova you can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger
So don't stress don't cry oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
As long as you love me we could be starving
We could be homeless we could be broke
As long as you love me I will be your platinum I will be your silver I will be your gold
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you lololololololove me
Big Sean  Rap Verse
I don't make if this make sense
You're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place I will rendezvous
I will fly it to ya I will meet you there
Girl you know I got you
Us trust a couple things I can't spell without you
No we on top of the world
Cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit
Now the sky's our point of view
Now we stepping out like woah
Cameras point at you ask me what's best side
I will stand back and point at you you you
The one that I argue with
Feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It is greener where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I rather work on this with you
Than then go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me we could be starving
We could be homeless we could be broke
As long as you love me I will be your platinum I will be your silver I will be your gold
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you lololololololove me
As long as you love me
This day and age we're living in 
Gives cause for apprehension 
With speed and new invention 
And things like fourth dimension 
Yet we get a trifle weary 
With Mr Einstein's theory 
So we must get down to earth at times 
Relax relieve the tension
And no matter what the progress 
Or what may yet be proved 
The simple facts of life are such 
They cannot be removed
You must remember this 
A kiss is just a kiss a sigh is just a sigh 
The fundamental things apply 
As time goes by
And when two lovers woo 
They still say I love you 
On that you can rely 
No matter what the future brings 
As time goes by
Moonlight and love songs 
Never out of date 
Hearts full of passion 
Jealousy and hate 
Woman needs man 
And man must have his mate 
That no one can deny
It is still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
Oh yes the world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
It is still the same old story 
A fight for love and glory 
A case of do or die 
The world will always welcome lovers 
As time goes by
Making my way down town 
Walking fast 
Faces pass  
And I'm home bound  
Staring blankly ahead 
Just making my way 
Making a way 
Through the crowd  
And I need you  
And I miss you 
And now I wonder 
If I could fall 
Into the sky 
Do you think time 
Would pass me by 
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you tonight  
It is always times like these  
When I think of you 
And I wonder  
If you ever think of me  
Cause everything's so wrong 
And I don't belong 
Living in  
Your precious memory  
Cause I need you 
And I miss you  
And now I wonder 
If I could fall 
Into the sky 
Do you think time 
Would pass me byoh 
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
You could buy me diamonds
You could buy me pearls
Take me on a cruise around the world
Baby you know I'm worth it
Dinner lit by candle
Run my bubble bath
Make love tenderly to last to last
Cause baby you know I'm worth it
Wanna please wanna keep wanna treat your woman right
Not just dough but to show that you know she is worth your time
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth
Mmm
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm Hmm Mm Hmmm
Mm
If you treat me fairly
I will give you all my goods
Treat you like a real woman should
Baby I know you're worth it
If you never play me
Promise not to bluff
I will hold you down when stuff gets rough
Cause baby I know you're worth it
She walks the mile makes you smile all the while being true
Don't take for granted the passions that she has for you
You will lose if you chose to refuse to put her first
She will if she can find a man who knows her worth
Oh
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
No need to read between the lines spelled out for you spelled out for you
Just hear this song cause you can't go wrong when you value better value
A woman's woman's
Woman's woman's
WORTH!
Cause a real man knows a real woman when he sees her
And a real woman knows a real man ain't afraid to please her
And a real woman knows a real man always comes first
And a real man just can't deny a woman's worth
It was so easy that night 
Shoulda been strong yeah I lied 
Nobody gets me like you do 
I know everything changes 
All the cities and faces 
But I know how I feel about you 
Can we bring yesterday back around 
'cause I know how I feel about you now 
I was dumb I was wrong 
I let you down 
But I know how I feel about you now 
All that it takes one more chance 
Don't let our last kiss be our last 
Give me tonight and I will show you 
I know everything changes 
I don't care where it takes us 
'cause I know how I feel about you 
Can we bring yesterday back around 
'cause I know how I feel about you now 
I was dumb I was wrong 
I let you down 
But I know how I feel about you now 
Not a day passed me by not a day passed me by 
When I don't think about you 
And there's no moving on 'cause I know you're the one 
And I can't be without you 
Can we bring yesterday back around 
'cause I know how I feel about you now 
I was dumb I was wrong 
I let you down 
But I know how I feel about you now 
Can we bring yesterday back around 
'cause I know how I feel about you now 
I was dumb I was wrong 
I let you down I let you down 
But I know how I feel about you now 
But I know how I feel about you now 
Yeah I know how I feel about you now

You all need to get ready to hear 
The unbelievable 
Indescribable 
Vanessa Hudgens 
Baby V
Everyday I try to play another game 
But my heart can't take it 
I try to find another boy 
But all the while I can't face it 
Why do I miss you so much 
I wanna stop this hurt inside 
Oh baby please give us one more try 
Baby come back
I see you out with all your friends 
Laughin' it up as you pretend 
To have a good time 
I know cause I'm living the same lie 
So one of us has got to say 
We can't keep living the same way 
So I will be the one 
Yeah I will say it I will say it I will say it I will say it again 
Baby come back to me 
In my heart I still believe 
We were meant to be 
Together so whatever it takes 
Baby come back to me 
I should have never set you free 
My baby 
Come back 
I wanna call but then I stall 
Cause after all I just couldn't take it 
Cause if your play was to push me away 
You know that day my heart you'd break it 
I know we made a mistake 
Can't you stop your foolish pride 
And come back to me 
Let's try Let's try Let's try Let's try it again 
Baby Come back to me 
In my heart I still believe 
We were meant to be 
Together so whatever it takes  
Baby come back to me 
I should have never set you free 
My baby 
Come back  
Baby come back
You know you miss your baby V
And I can see that you think about me 
So why do you act like you don't care 
Like all this love between us isn't there 
I know that you're upset 
I know I did you wrong 
I know you want me to pay for all the pain I've caused 
But in the end it all comes down to just one thing 
It is you and me 
So I sing 
Baby Come Back! 
Baby Come back to me 
In my heart I still believe 
We were meant to be 
Together so whatever it takes 
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free 
My baby 
Come back 
Baby Come Back

Bet On It
He Said She Said
I Don't Dance
It Takes Two
Start Of Something New
Work This Out
You Are The Music In Me
AND
All in This Together
Bop to the Top
Breaking Free
Can't Take My Eyes Off You
Start of Something New
Stick to the Status Quo
What I've Been Looking For
When There was You and Me
Inside my skin
There is this space
It twists and turns
It bleeds and aches
Inside my heart
There's an empty room
It is waiting for lightning
It is waiting for you
I am wanting and
I am needing you
To be here
Inside the absence
Of fear
Muscle and sinew
Velvet and stone
This vessel is haunted
It creaks and moans
My bones call to you
In a separate skin
I will make myself translucent
To let you in
I am wanting and
I am needing you
To be here
Inside the absence
Of fear
There is the splendor of this
Secret inside of me
And it knows that you're no stranger
You're my gravity
My hands will adore you through all darkness
And they will lay you out in moonlight
And reinvent your name
I am wanting and
I am needing you
To be here
I need you near
Inside the absence
Of fear
Girl don't you know It is all I can do 
To keep my hands off of you 
Anytime you're around 
When the stars come out at night 
I dream of holdin' you tight 
Everytime I lay down 
It feels so good for me to have you this way 
The only other thing 
I wish I had was a chance 
A chance 
To tell you how I feel about you 
And how it feels to live without a chance 
A chance 
To tell you I will love you forever 
Knowing that I will never have a chance 
Sometimes reality hurts 
And you wonder if life's worth 
Living at all 
Knowing no matter how much you care 
You'll never have a prayer 
Of having what you want 
At least I've been close enough I could taste 
Beauty at It is best 
But never a trace of a chance 
A chance 
To tell you how I feel about you 
And how it feels to live without a chance 
A chance 
To tell you I will love you forever 
Knowing that I will never have a chance 
A chance a chance 
To tell you I will love you forever 
Knowing that I will never have a chance
Your lights are on but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep you can't eat
There's no doubt you're in deep
Your throat is tight you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh
Yeah
It is closer to the truth to say you can't get enough you
Know you're
Gonna have to face it you're addicted to love
You see the signs but you can't read
You're runnin' at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine a one track mind
You can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do
Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh
Yeah
It is closer to the truth to say you can't get enough you
Know you're
Gonna have to face it you're addicted to love

Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats and teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine
Whoa you like to think that you're immune to the stuff oh

I've been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I've never had a yearning quite like this before
Know that you are walking right through my door
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I will ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I will ever see you again
A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Until you cried never
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I will ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I will ever see you again
At every time I've always known
That you where there upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you my love forever
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I will ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I will ever see you again
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I will ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I will ever see you again
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I will ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I will ever see you again
I wonder if I will ever see you again
I wonder if I will ever see you again
I wonder if I will ever see you again
I wonder if I will ever see you again
How can I just let you walk away 
just let you leave without a trace  
When I stand here taking every breath with you ooh 
You're the only one who really knew me at all  
How can you just walk away from me  
when all I can do is watch you leave  
'cause We have shared the laughter and the pain  
and even shared the tears  
You're the only one who really knew me at all   
So take a look at me now  
oh there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me  
just the memory of your face  
Ooh take a look at me now  
well there's just an empty space  
And you coming back to me is against all odds  
and that's what I've got to face   
I wish I could just make you turn around  
turn around and see me cry  
There's so much I need to say to you  
so many reasons why  
You're the only one who really knew me at all   
So take a look at me now  
well there's just an empty space  
And there's nothing left here to remind me  
just the memory of your face  
Now take a look at me now  
'cause there's just an empty space  
But to wait for you is all I can do  
and that's what I've got to face   
Take a good look at me now  
cos I will still be standing here  
And you coming back to me is against all odds  
It is the chance I've gotta take   
Take a look at me now 
If you need me call me 
No matter where you are 
No matter how far 
Just call my name 
I will be there in a hurry 
On that you can depend 
and never worry
You see my love is alive 
It is like a seed that only needs 
The thought of you to grow
So if you feel the need for company
Please my darling let it be me 
I may not be able to express
The depth of the love I feel for you 
But a writer put it very nicely
When he was away from the one he loved
He sat down and wrote these words
No wind no rain 
Nor winter's cold
Can stop me babe
If you're my goal
No wind no rain
Can stop me babe
If you wanna go
I know I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
But remember
If you should fall short of your desires
Remember life holds for you one guarantee
You'll always have me
And if you should miss my love
One of these old days
If you should ever miss the arms
That used to hold you so close or the lips
That used to touch you so tenderly
Just remember what I told you
The day I set you free
Ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough Say it again
Ain't no river wild enough
To keep me from you  
Do your thing honey   
I had feelings from the start
Couldn't stand to be apart
Something about you caught my eye 
Something moved me deep inside
Don't know what you did boy but 
You had it and I've been hooked ever since 
I told my mother my brother my sister and my friend 
I told the others my lovers from past and present tense 
Everytime I see you everything starts making sense
Do your thing honey 
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you 
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do 
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon 
You got soul you got class
You got style with your bad a oh yeah 
Ain't no other man its true alright  
Ain't no other man but you
Do your thang honey
Never thought I'd be alright
No no no
Till you came and changed my life
Yeah yeah yeah
What was cloudy now is clear
Yeah yeah
For the light that I needed
You got what I want boy and I want it
So keep on givin' it up
Tell your mother your brother your sister and your friend
And the others your lovers better not be present tense
'Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's 
Ain't no other man can stand up next to you 
Ain't no other man on the planet does what you do 
You're the kinda guy a girl finds in a blue moon 
You got soul you got class

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
It is not warm when she's away 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
and she's always gone too long 
anytime she goes away 
Wonder this time where she's gone 
Wonder if she's gonna stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
and this house just ain't no home 
anytime she goes away 
And I knowI know I know I know I know 
I knowI know I know I know I know 
I knowI know I know I know I know 
I knowI know I know I know I know 
I know hey I ought to leave the young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Only darkness everyday
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
and this house just ain't no home 
anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away anytime she goes away 
Anytime she goes away

A little less fight and a little more spark
Close your mouth and open up your heart and baby satisfy me

Son she said have I got a little story for you
What you thought was your daddy was nothin' but a
While you were sittin' home alone at age thirteen
Your real daddy was dyin'
Sorry you didn't see him
But I'm glad we talked
Oh I oh I'm still alive
Hey I I oh I'm still alive
Hey I oh I'm still alive
Oh she walks slowly across a young man's room
She said I'm ready for you
I can't remember anything to this very day
Except the look the look
Oh you know where now I can't see I just stare
I I'm still alive
Hey I but I'm still alive
Hey I boy I'm still alive
Hey I I I I'm still alive yeah
Is something wrong she said
Well of course there is
You're still alive she said
Oh and do I deserve to be
Is that the question
And if so if so who answers who answers
I oh I'm still alive
Hey I oh I'm still alive
Hey I but I'm still alive
Yeah I ooh I'm still alive
When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
Livin' alone
I think of all the friends I've known
When I dial the telephone
Nobody's home
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And loves so distant and obscure
Remains the cure
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
All by myself
Anymore
When I was young
I never needed anyone
Making love was just for fun
Those days are gone
All by myself
Don't wanna be
All by myself
Anymore
All by myself
Don't wanna live
Oh
Don't wanna live
By myself by myself
Anymore
By myself
Anymore
Oh
All by myself
Don't wanna live
I never never never
Needed anyone 
When It is love you give
I will be a man of good faith
Then in love you live
I will make a stand I won't break
I will be the rock you can build on
Be there when you're old
To have and to hold 
When there's love inside
I swear I will always be strong
Then there's a reason why
I will prove to you we belong
I will be the wall that protects you
From the wind and the rain
From the hurt and pain
Let's make it all for one and all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when It is all for one It is one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
When It is love you make
I will be the fire in your night
Then It is love you take
I will defend I will fight
I will be there when you need me
When honor's at stake
This vow I will make
That It is all for one and all for love
Let the one be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when It is all for one It is one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
And make it all for one and all for love
Don't lay our love to rest
'Cause we could stand up to you test
We got everything and more than we had planned
More than the rivers that run the land
We have got it all in our hands
Now It is all for one and all for love
It is all for love
Let the one you hold be the one you want
The one you need
'Cause when It is all for one It is one for all
It is one for all
When there's someone that should know
Then just let your feelings show
When there's someone that you want
When there's someone that you need
Let's make it all all for one and all for love

I gave you my music
made your song take wing
and now how you've
repaid me 
denied me
and betrayed me
He was bound to love you
when he heard you sing
Christine

Say you'll share with
me one

and I will follow you
Share each day with
me each
night each morning
Phantom
You will curse the day
you did not do
all that the Phantom asked
of you!
What would I do without your smart mouth
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
Got my head spinning no kidding I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy don't know what hit me but I will be alright
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I will give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all all of me
And you give me all all of you
How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down I'm around through every move
You're my downfall you're my muse
My worst distraction my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing It is ringing in my head for you
My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I will give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all all of you
Give me all of you
Cards on the table we're both showing hearts
Risking it all though It is hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I will give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all all of me
And you give me all all of you 
You took my kisses and all my love
You taught me how to care
Am I to be just remnant of a onesided love affair
All you took I gladly gave
There is nothing left for me to save
All of me
Why not take all of me
Can't you see
I'm no good without you
Take my lips
I want to lose them
Take my arms
I will never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on dear without you
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me
Time
I've been passing time watching trains go by
All of my life
Lying on the sand watching seabirds fly
Wishing there would be
Someone waiting home for me
Something's telling me it might be you
It is telling me it might be you
All of my life
Looking back
as lovers go walking past
All of my life
Wondering how they met and what makes it last
If I found the place
Would I recognize the face
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah It is telling me it might be you
So many quiet walks to take
So many dreams to wake
And We have so much love to make
I think we're gonna need some time
Maybe all we need is time
And It is telling me it might be you
All of my life
I've been saving love songs and lullabies
And there's so much more
No one's ever heard before
Something's telling me it might be you
Yeah It is telling me it must be you
And I'm feeling it'll just be you
All of my life
It is you
It is you
I've been waiting for
all of my life
Maybe It is you
Maybe It is you
I've been waiting for
all of my life
Maybe It is you
Maybe It is you
I've been waiting for
all of my life
I am lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too
but what else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know doesn't really know
I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that
I was so wrong
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right 
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on 
There's no easy way it gets harder each day 
Please love me or I will be gone I will be gone
I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that
I was so wrong
Ooh what are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
what are you thinking of 
I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love what am I without you
I can't be too late I know I was so wrong
I'm all out of love I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love what am I without you
I can't be too late to say that I was so wrong
All my friends say that I'm a fool 
And that I should give up on you  
Many times I've surely tried  
But there is something down deep inside   
I've spent some time trying to think all this through  
And I always end up wanting to be with you  
Como una flor que necesita el agua  
Sin tu amor se marchita mi alma   
You will always be  
Always mine  
Be mine 'til the end of time  
Always mine  
You will always be  
Always mine 
Be mine 'til the end of time  
Always mine  
 all  
Always mine all of mine  
You'll be mine 'til the end of time  
Siempre mío todo mío  
Cuando no estás yo siento frío  
Always mine all of mine  
You'll be mine 'til the end of time  
Siempre mío todo mío  
Cuando no estás yo siento frío   
  Maybe I didn't treat you 
Quite as good as I should have 
Maybe I didn't love you 
Quite as often as I could have 
Little things I should have said and done 
I just never took the time 
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind 
Maybe I didn't hold you 
All those lonely lonely times 
And I guess I never told you 
I'm so happy that you're mine 
If I made you feel second best 
Girl I'm so sorry I was blind 
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind 
Tell me tell me that your sweet love hasn't died 
Give me give me one more chance to keep you satisfied satisfied 
Little things I should have said and done 
I just never took the time 
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind 
You were always on my mind 
Oh her eyes her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair her hair falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful and I tell her every day
Yeah I know I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And It is so It is so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look ok I say
When I see your face there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing just the way you are yeah
Her lips her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh she hates but I think It is so sexy
She's so beautiful and I tell her every day
Oh you know you know you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for then just stay the same
So don't even bother  if you look oky
You know I will say
When I see your face there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile the whole world stops and stares for a while
Because girl you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile the whole world stops and stares for a while
Cause girl you're amazing just the way you are 
Yeah
Don't wanna be an American idiot
Don't want a nation under the new mania
And can you hear the sound of hysteria
The subliminal mindf America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Well maybe I'm the fot America
I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
Now everybody do the propaganda
And sing along in the age of paranoia
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Don't wanna be an American idiot
One nation controlled by the media
Information age of hysteria
It is calling out to idiot America
Welcome to a new kind of tension
All across the alienation
Everything isn't meant to be okay
Television dreams of tomorrow
We're not the ones who're meant to follow
For that's enough to argue
Put your head against my life 
What do you hear 
A million words just trying to make 
The love song of the year 
Close your eyes but don't forget 
What you have heard 
A man who's trying to say three words 
The words that make me scared 
A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Looking to the future now 
This is what I see 
A million chances pass me by 
A million chances to hold you 
Take me back take me back 
To where I used to be 
To hide away from all my truth 
Through the light I see 
A million love songs later 
And here I am trying to tell you that I care 
A million love songs later 
And here I am 
Am I wrong for thinking out the box from where I stay
Am I wrong for saying that I will choose another way
I ain't trying to do what everybody else doing
Just cause everybody doing what they all do
If one thing I know how far would I grow
I'm walking down this road of mine this road that I call home
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see
But that's just how I feel that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
Am I tripping for having ambition
My prediction I'mma be on the top of the world
Hope you hope you don't look back always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life that's just how I feel
Fight for yours and don't let go don't let them compare you no
Don't worry you're not alone that's just how we feel
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see
But that's just how I feel that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
If you tell me I'm wrong wrong
I don't wanna be right right
If you tell me I'm wrong wrong
I don't wanna be right
Am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see
But that's just how I feel that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
So am I wrong for thinking that we could be something for real
Now am I wrong for trying to reach the things that I can't see
But that's just how I feel that's just how I feel
That's just how I feel trying to reach the things that I can't see
I've been here all your life 
Watching your crying game
You were the heaven in my lonely world 
And he was your sun 
And your rain
I was losing you before 
I ever held you tight
Before you ever held me in your arms
And I won't make you blue
And maybe an everlasting love will do
Ah we got an everlasting love
So tall so wide so high 
Above the rumble of thunder down below
It is your love I need 
It is the only show
And It is you want an everlasting dream
Can take us anywhere are the tears of yesterday
We killed the pain 
We blew away the memories 
Of the tears we cried
And an everlasting love will never die
Take me out of the cold give me what I've hungered for
If It is the pleasure of taking 
My heart that you need then it only makes me
Love you more
I was yours before 
The stars were born and you were mine
I could have saved you all the pain you knew
And I won't make you cry
And maybe an everlasting love can try 
Girl you're looking fine tonight
and every guy has got you in his sights
What you're doing with a clown like me
is surely one of life's little mysteries
So tonight I will ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love
What did I do
What did I say
to turn your angel eyes my way
Well I'm the guy who never learned to dance
never even got one second glance
Across a crowded room was close enough
I could look but I could never touch
So tonight I will ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love
What did I do
What did I say
to turn your angel eyes my way
Don't anyone wake me
if It is just a dream
'Cause she's the best thing
that's ever happened to me
All you fellows you can look all you like
but this girl you see she's leavin' here with me tonight
There's just one more thing that I have to know
if this is love why does it scare me so
It must be something only you can see
'cause girl I feel it when you look at me
So tonight I will ask the stars above
How did I ever win your love
What did I do
What did I say
to turn your angel eyes my way
I sit and waitdoes an angel contemplate my fate and do they know the places
Where we go when we're gray and old
cause I've been told that salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed thoughts running through my head
And i feel that love is dead I'm loving Jessica Simpson instead
And through it all He offers me protection A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me
When I come to call He won't forsake me I'm loving Jessica Simpson instead
When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street I look above
And I know I will always be blessed with love and as the feeling grows
He breathes flesh to my bones and when love is dead
I'm loving Jessica Simpson instead
And through it all He offers me protection A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me
When I come to call He won't forsake me I'm loving Jessica Simpson instead
I'm loving Jessica Simpson instead
 And through it all He offers me protection A lot of love and affection
Whether I'm right or wrong 
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me I know that life won't break me
When I come to call He won't forsake me I'm loving Jessica Simpson instead
Gee but It is tough to be broke kid 
It is not a joke kid It is a curse 
My luck is changing It is gotten
from simply rotten to something worse
Who knows someday I will win too
I will begin to reach my prime
Now though I see what our end is
All I spend is just my time
I can't give you anything but love baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of baby
Dream awhile scheme awhile we're sure to find
Happiness and I guess all those things you've always pined for
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell my litle baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell baby
Till that lucky day you know darned well baby
I can't give you anything but love
Till that lucky day you know darned well baby
I can't give you anything but love
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun the stars the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way believe me
Even through the darkest night you know
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know It is true
Baby I'd go anywhere for you
I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole world
To know
Hey baby hey baby hey baby oohhh
I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around and say
That It is too late to apologize
It is too late
I said It is too late to apologize
It is too late
I'd take another chance take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But It is nothing new  yeah
I loved you with the a fire red 
Now It is turning blue and you say
Sorry like an angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid
hey hey
It is too late to apologize It is too late
I said It is too late to apologize It is too late
I said It is too late to apologize yeah 
I said It is too late to apologize yeah 
I'm holding on your rope got me ten feet off the ground 
It is too late to apologize It is too late
I said It is too late to apologize It is too late
I said It is too late to apologize yeah 
I said It is too late to apologize yeah 
I'm holding on your rope got me ten feet off the ground 
Girl you're every breath I take 
Oh baby 
Your love rules every move I make 
Oh baby 
And I know that you can't read my mind 
And baby maybe I 
Don't say it as often as I should 
But I really want it to be heard 
When I say I love you that's for good 
You have my word 
That day after day after all 
I will always be true 
That's a promise I make to you 
You you take this heart of mine 
And make it better 
I need you to 
Come and walk with me through this life 
Forever 
And I know these words are long over due 
And baby maybe I 
Don't say it as often as I should 
But I really want it to be heard 
When I say I love you that's for good 
You have my word 
That day after day after all 
I will always be true 
That's a promise I make to you 
I may hold you 
I may need you 
I may want to 
And baby maybe I 
Don't say it as often as I should 
But I really want it to be heard 
When I say I love you that's for good 
You have my word 
That day after day after all 
I will always be true 
That's a promise I make to you 
A promise I make to you 
A promise I make to you 
I'm gonna do it darlin'
I could waste time tryin' the figure it out
But I'm jumpin' in anyhow
I've never been this far
Didn't know love could run so deep
Didn't know I'd lose this much sleep
Holdin' you close chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
loving just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights huntin' down dreams
Figurin' out what love really means
Baby givin' you my heart
Is a real fine place to start
Somethin' is going on
I can't explain but sure can touch
It is callin' both of us
Stronger than any fear or doubt
It is changin' everything I see
It is changin' you It is changin' me
Right here right now's the perfect spot the perfect time
The perfect moment when your skin is next to mine
Yeah yeah
Holdin' you close
Chasin' that moon
Spendin' all night
loving just who you are
Sparks flyin' in the dark
Shootin' out lights
Runnin' down dreams
Figurin' out just what love really means
Baby givin' you my heart's a real fine place
Real fine place to start
Are you all right
All of a sudden you went away
Are you all right
I hope you come back around someday
Are you all right
I haven't seen you in a real long time
Are you all right
Could you give me some kind of sign
Are you all right
I looked around me and you were gone
Are you all right
I feel like there must be something wrong
Are you all right
Cause it seems like you disappeared
Are you all right
Cause I've been feeling a little scared
Are you all right
Are you sleeping through the night
Do you have someone to hold you tight
Do you have someone to hang out with
Do you have someone to hug & kiss you
Hug & kiss you
Hug & kiss you
Are you all right
Are you all right
Is there something been bothering you
Are you all right
I wish you'd give me a little clue
Are you all right
Is there something you want to say
Are you all right
Just tell me that you're OK
Are you all right
Cause you took off without a word
Are you all right
You flew away like a little bird
Are you all right
Is there anything I can do
Are you all right
Cause I need to hear from you
Are you all right
Are you sleeping through the night
Do you have someone to hold you tight
Do you have someone to hang out with
Do you have someone to hug & kiss you
Hug & kiss you
Hug & kiss you 
Are you all right
Are you all right
Are you all right
My heart was once just like a home 
With many rooms and open doors 
And I always let love in 
It would change the rooms around and then 
Leave them empty 
Till one by one I locked each door 
And soon forgot what love was for 
But I never gave up hopin' 
So I left just one door open 
In case you found me 
So there's a room in my heart for you 
If your trust has been stolen too 
If you walk softly on this worn out wooden floor 
And leave behind you the hurt you've had before 
There's a room in my heart for you 
we will paint the walls from blue to white 
And set the mood by candlelight 
Together we will keep out the cold 
And I will still be there when we're old 
If you'll let me 
So there's a room in my heart for you 
If your trust has been stolen too 
If you walk softly on this worn out wooden floor 
And leave behind you the hurt you've had before 
There's a room in my heart for you 
Just leave behind you the hurt you've had before 
There's a room in my heart for you 
She said 'I've seen you in here before'
I said 'I've been here a time or two'
She said 'Hello my name is Bobby Jo
Meet my twin sister Betty Lou
And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight
And you're the only cowboy in this place
And if you're up for a rodeo
we will put a big Texas smile on your face'
I said 'Girls'
I ain't as good as I once was
I got a few years on me now
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really lay it down
And if you need some love tonight
Then I might have just enough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
I still hang out with my best friend Dave
I've known him since we were kids at school
Last night he had a few shots
Got in a tight spot hustling a game of pool
With a couple of readneck boys
One great big bad biker man
I heard David yell across the room
'Hey buddy how about a helping hand
I said 
I ain't as good as I once was
My how the years have flown
But there was a time back in my prime
When I could really hold my own
But if you wanna fight tonight
Guess thouse boys dont look all that tough
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
I used to be Hell on wheels
Back when I was younger man
Now my body says 'You can't do this boy'
But my pride says 'Oh yes you can
I ain't as good as I once was
Thats just the cold hard truth
I still throw a few back talk a little smack
When I'm feeling bullet proof
So don't double dog dare me now
'Cause I'd have to call your bluff
I ain't as good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
Maybe not be good as I once was
But I'm as good once as I ever was
This mornin' is Monday
Where are you now
Teasin' my memory
Tellin' me how
To lay low when I don't want to
Your love is elusive
This I know now
It is makin' me crazy
Leavin' me out in the open
When I don't want to
Baby I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire 
you're runnin' all over town
As much as you've burned me baby 
I should be ashes by now
The moments of pleasure
Never do last
They're gone like a suitcase
Full of your past
Long gone
And in a hurry
Baby I can't go through this again
I don't need to go down more than I've already been
Just like a wildfire 
you're runnin' all over town
As much as you've burned me baby 
I should be ashes by now
You're runnin' all over town
As much as you burned me baby 
I should be ashes by now
Just like a wildfire 
you're runnin' all over town
As much as you've burned me baby 
I should be ashes by now
As much as you've burned me baby 
I should be ashes by now
Ooh ooh ooh ashes by now
Ooh ooh ooh ashes by now
As much as you've burned me baby I should be ashes by now
Cause you're a sky 
cause you're a sky full of stars
I'm gonna give you my heart
Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
Cause you light up the park
I don't care go on and tear me apart
I don't care if you do!
Cause in a sky
cause in a sky full of stars
I think I saw you
Cause you're a sky cause you're a sky full of stars
I wanna die in your arms arms
Cause you get lighter the more it gets dark
I'm gonna give you my heart
And I don't care go on and tear me apart
And I don't care if you do
Cause in a sky 
cause in a sky full of stars
I think I see you
I think I see you
You're a sky you're a sky full of stars
Such a Heavenly view
Such a Heavenly view
At last 
my love has come along 
my lonely days are over 
and life is like a song 
Ooh yeah yeah
At last 
the skies above are blue 
My heart was wrapped up in clover 
the night I looked at you 
I found a dream 
that I could speak to 
A dream that I 
can call my own 
I found a thrill 
to press my cheek to 
A thrill that I have never known 
Ohh yeah yeah
You smile 
you smile 
Ooh and then the spell was cast 
And here we are in heaven 
for you are mine at last 
What did you think 
I would do at this moment
When you're standing before me
With tears in your eyes
Trying to tell me 
that you have found you another
and you just don't love me no more
What did you think 
I would say at this moment
When I'm faced with the knowledge 
That you just don't love me
Did you think I would curse you
Or say things to hurt you
'cause you just don't love me no more
Did you think 
I could hate you
Or raise my hands to you
Now come on you know me too well
How could I hurt you 
when darling I love you
and you know 
I'd never never hurt youoowooo 
What do you think 
I would give at this moment
If you'd stay 
I'd subtract twenty years from my life
I'd fall down on my knees
and kiss the ground that you walk on 
If I could just hold you again
I'd fall down on my knees
I'd kiss the ground that you walk on baby
If I could just hold you 
If I could just hold you  
If I if I could just holdhold you again
We have time for racism
We have time for criticism
Held bondage by our ism's 
When will there be a time to love
We make time to debate religion
Passing bills and building prisons
For building fortunes and passing judgements
When will there be a time to love
At this point in history we have a choice to make
To either walk a path of love
Or be crippled by our hate
We have time to cause pollution
We have time to cause confusion
All wrapped up in our own illusions
When will there be a time to love
We make time to conquer nations
Time for oil exploration
Hatred violence and terrorism
When will there be a time to love
At this moment in time
We have a choice to make
Father God is watching
While we cause mother earth so much pain
It is such a shame
Not enough money for
The young the old and the poor
But for war there is always more
When will there be a time to love
We make time for paying taxes
Or paying bills and buying status
But we will pay the consequences
If we don't make the time to love
Now's the time to pay attention
Yes now is the time  to love
A time love  love
A time to love
Please please won't you tell me
When will there be a time to love
You think you know me
Word on the street is that you do
You want my history
What others tell you won't be true
I walked a thousand miles while everyone was asleep
Nobody's really seen my million subtleties
Got stains on my tshirt and I'm the biggest flirt
Right now I'm solo but that will be changing eventually oh
Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark
If you want my auto want my autobiography
Baby just ask me
I hear you talking
Well It is my turn now
I'm talking back
Look in my eyes
So you can see just where I'm at
I walked a thousand miles to find one river of peace
I walked a million more to find out what this shit means
Got stains on my tshirt and I'm the biggest flirt
Right now I'm solo but that will be changing eventually oh
Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark
If you want my auto want my autobiography
Baby just ask me
I'm a bad ass girl in this messed up world
I'm the sexy girl in this crazy world
I'm a simple girl in a complex world
A nasty girl you wanna get with me
You wanna mess with me
Got stains on my tshirt and I'm the biggest flirt
Right now I'm solo but that will be changing eventually oh
I laugh more than I cry
You piss me off goodbye
Got bruises on my heart and sometimes I get dark
If you want my auto want my autobiography
Baby just ask me
Standin' on the star of Marilyn Monroe
I've got a dream and a map of some stars homes
Down on the Boulevard all the kids look like me
Faith in my pocket and my Saturdays free
No time for all my insecurities
But nobody knows
The fight inside I will never show
I've got a backpack filled with what I own
Everybody's watin' for me to come home
She didn't make it she didn't take it so far
On Avenue of the stars
I made a deal with God that I will win
If I don't make it in a year
I will pack it in
I just wanna be anywhere but where I've been
With all of your doubts
I'm not gonna let you count me out
I've got a backpack filled with what I own
Everybody's waitin' for me to come home
She didn't make it she didn't take it so far
I've got nobody but I'm not alone
World full of dreamers that will never go home
We may not make it we're gonna take it so far
On Avenue of the stars
There is no way I'm backin' out
I will find an angel here somehow
If It is good or bad this is my town
I'n never gonna go home
Never gonna go home
She didn't make it she didn't take it so far
On Avenue of the stars
I've got nobody but I'm not alone
World full of dreamers that will never go home
We may not make it we're gonna take it so far
On avenue of the stars
On the Avenue of the stars
What nobody knows
I'm gonna take it so far
She's gonna make it
She's never gonna make it
World full of dreamers that will never go home
I'm gonna make it here on my own
She didnt make it
I've got a dream and a map of some stars homes
I woke up early with a poundin' in my head
I'd been out the night before with all my friends
A little worried kinda wonderin' what I did
I said Lord please forgive me for my sins
My wife wanted to kill me but she tried to save me first
You're going if I have to drag your butt to church
I love this crazy tragic
Sometimes almost magic
Awful beautful life
I read the hymns and kinda sorta sang along
And made it through the Sunday sermon wide awake
We met the family for dinner at our home
Drank some beer watched a game and cooked some steaks
My little brother had a big fight with his wife
And my poor mother sat between 'em both all night
We said a prayer for Cousin Michael in Iraq
We're all aware that he may never make it back
We talked about the way we missed his stupid jokes
And how he loved to be a soldier more than most
I laid in bed that night and thought about the day
And how my life is like a roller coaster ride
The ups and downs and crazy turns along the way
It'll throw you off if you don't hold on tight
You can't really smile until you've shed some tears
I could die today or I might live on for years
Alright
It is a beautiful life
Awful beautiful life
I love this life
It is a beautiful life
We skipped the light Fandango
Turned cartwheels 'cross the floor
I was feeling kind of seasick
But the crowd called out for more
The room was humming harder
As the ceiling flew away
When we called out for another drink
The waiter brought a tray
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
She said there is no reason
And the truth is plain to see
But I wandered through my playing cards
And would not let her be
One of sixteen vestal virgins
Who were leaving for the coast
And although my eyes were open
They might just as well've been closed
And so it was that later
As the miller told his tale
That her face at first just ghostly
Turned a whiter shade of pale
You all need to get ready to hear 
The unbelievable 
Indescribable 
Vanessa Hudgens 
Baby V
Everyday I try to play another game 
But my heart can't take it 
I try to find another boy 
But all the while I can't face it 
Why do I miss you so much 
I wanna stop this hurt inside 
Oh baby please give us one more try 
Baby come back
I see you out with all your friends 
Laughin' it up as you pretend 
To have a good time 
I know cause I'm living the same lie 
So one of us has got to say 
We can't keep living the same way 
So I will be the one 
Yeah I will say it I will say it I will say it I will say it again 
Baby come back to me 
In my heart I still believe 
We were meant to be 
Together so whatever it takes 
Baby come back to me 
I should have never set you free 
My baby 
Come back 
I wanna call but then I stall 
Cause after all I just couldn't take it 
Cause if your play was to push me away 
You know that day my heart you'd break it 
I know we made a mistake 
Can't you stop your foolish pride 
And come back to me 
Let's try Let's try Let's try Let's try it again 
Baby Come back to me 
In my heart I still believe 
We were meant to be 
Together so whatever it takes  
Baby come back to me 
I should have never set you free 
My baby 
Come back  
Baby come back
You know you miss your baby V
And I can see that you think about me 
So why do you act like you don't care 
Like all this love between us isn't there 
I know that you're upset 
I know I did you wrong 
I know you want me to pay for all the pain I've caused 
But in the end it all comes down to just one thing 
It is you and me 
So I sing 
Baby Come Back! 
Baby Come back to me 
In my heart I still believe 
We were meant to be 
Together so whatever it takes 
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free 
My baby 
Come back 
Baby Come Back
Spending all my nights
All my money going out on the town
Doing anything just to get you off of my mind
But when the morning comes
I'm right back where I started again
Trying to forget you is just a waste of time
Baby come back any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
All day long wearing a mask of false bravado
Trying to keep up the smile that hides a tear
But as the sun goes down I get that empty feeling again
How I wish to God that you were here
Baby come back any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
Now that I put it all together
Give me the chance to make you see
Have you used up all the love in your heart
Nothing left for me ain't there nothing left for me
Baby come back any kind of fool could see
There was something in everything about you
Baby come back you can blame it all on me
I was wrong and I just can't live without you
Shadows grow so long before my eyes 
And they're moving across the page 
Suddenly the day turns into night 
Far away from the city but don't hesitate 
'Cause your love won't wait hey 
Ooh baby I love your way every day 
Wanna tell you I love your way every day 
Wanna be with you night and day 
Moon appears to shine and light the sky 
With the help of some fireflies 
I wonder how they have the power shine shine shine 
I can see them under the pines 
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait hey 
Ooh baby I love your way every day 
Wanna tell you I love your way every day 
Wanna be with you night and day uh yeah 
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait 
I can see the sunset in your eyes 
Brown and grey and blue besides 
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun 
Wish I could dry one out of season 
But don't hesitate 'cause your love won't wait hey 
Ooh baby I love your way every day 
Wanna tell you I love your way uuhh 
Wanna be with you night and day 
Ooh baby I love your way every day 
Wanna tell you I love your way uuhh

Maybe I'ma crazy but I just can't live without
Your loving and affection givin' me direction
Like a guiding light to help me through a darkest hour
Lately I'ma prayin' that you'll always bea stayin' beside me
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Feeling all the while and never really knowing why
Lately I'ma prayin' that you'll always bea stayin' beside me
Used to be my life was just emotions passing by
Then you came along and made me laugh and made me cry
You taught me why

That something wasn't right here
Oh baby baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now what We have got 
My loneliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time 
Oh baby baby
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you got me blinded
Oh baby baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
That's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now what We have got 
My loneliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time 
Oh baby baby
Oh baby baby
Ah yeah yeah
Oh baby baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My loneliness is killing me
I must confess I still believe
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
I must confess that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life tell me how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing that I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing that I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile so good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
the first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
If we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it  but I can't
So if the chain is on your door I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing that I'd realized what I had when you were mine and
I go back to December turn around and make it all right and
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind 
I go back to December all the time
Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to gray
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on
You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces everytime
And I don't need no carryin' on
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Well you need a blue sky holiday
The point is they laugh at what you say
And I don't need no carryin' on
You had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day
Sometimes the system goes on the blink
And the whole thing turns out wrong
You might not make it back and you know
That you could be well oh that strong
And I'm not wrong
So where is the passion when you need it the most
Oh you and I
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
You've seen what you like
And how does it feel for one more time
You had a bad day
You had a bad day
Do you ever have that dream
Where you're walking naked down the street
And everyone just stares
Do you ever feel so deep
That you speak your mind
To put others straight to sleep
You wonder if anybody cares
Sometimes I think I'm the only one
Whose day turned out unlike it had begun
And I feel bare naked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No I just can't fake it anymore
'Cause I'm bare naked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day
You ever go downstairs to start your day
But your car's not there
Yeah you know the joke's on you
You ever try your luck with a pickup line
But you just sucked
You tell yourself it wasn't you
And I know It is hard to hold it inside
It is days like these I run and hide
When I feel bare naked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No I just can't fake it anymore
'Cause I'm bare naked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day
It is all a state of mind
But I don't mind trying to find a way
To keep my head above the mess I make
What the world creates
Sometimes it feels so good to let it all fall
As the world fall
I may fall
We all may fall
And then the world comes tumbling
Down down down down down
I'm bare naked
And I just can't take it
I'm getting jaded
No I just can't fake it anymore
'Cause I'm bare naked
And I know life's what you make it
Wish I could float away
To some other day
When I feel feel
I love the way you stand in my way
You won't move Till you get a kiss
And how you tell me that my name
It tastes so sweet on your lips
I love the way you hold me with your eyes
Hold me so tight that I can't move
It is like everything I've ever known is a lie
And you're the simple truth
Is it a dream or is it real
All I know is you make me feel so beautiful beautiful beautiful
You make me feel so beautiful feel like I could fly
Beautiful  cross the clear blue sky
Beautiful  baby I could cry
You make me feel so beautiful
I love how soft you touch my skin
Like you're touching the wings of a butterfly
I wish we could just lock ourselves away in a room
Where there was no such thing as time
I've never let anyone get this close
I've always been afraid
But you break down every wall and I feel so safe
Every part of who I am
Is so in love cause what I have is beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
You make me feel so beautiful feel like I could fly
Beautiful  cross the clear blue sky
Beautiful  baby I could cry
You make me feel so beautiful
Beautiful
You make me feel so beautiful when you touch my face
Beautiful  when you say my name
Beautiful  always find the way
You make me feel so beautiful
My life is brilliant
My love is pure
I saw an angel
Of that I'm sure
She smiled at me on the subway
She was with another man
But I won't lose no sleep on that
'Cause I've got a plan
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful It is true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I will never be with you
Yeah she caught my eye
As we walked on by
She could see from my face that I was
Flying high
And I don't think that I will see her again
But we shared a moment that will last Till the end
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful It is true
I saw your face in a crowded place
And I don't know what to do
'Cause I will never be with you
You're beautiful
You're beautiful
You're beautiful It is true
There must be an angel with a smile on her face
When she thought up that I should be with you
But It is time to face the truth
I will never be with you
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal
When you say It is over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal suicidal
When they say It is over
See it started at the park
Used to chill at the dark
Oh when you took my heart
That's when we fell apart
Coz we both thought
That love lasts forever lasts forever
They say we're too young
To get ourselves sprung
Oh we didn't care
We made it very clear
And they also said
That we couldn't last together last together
See It is very define girl
One of a kind
But you mush up my mind
You want to get declined
Oh Lord
My baby is driving me crazy
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal
When you say It is over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal suicidal
When they say It is over
It was back in '99
Watching movies all the time
Oh when I went away
For doing my first crime
And I never thought
That we was gonna see each other see each other
And then I came out
Mami moved me down South
Oh I'm with my girl
Who I thought was my world
It came out to be
That she wasn't the girl for me girl for me
Refrain
See It is very define girl
One of a kind
But you mush up my mind
You walk to get declined
Oh Lord   
My baby is driving me crazy
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal
When you say It is over
Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal suicidal
When they say It is over
Now we're a fussing
And now we're a fighting
Please tell me why
I'm feeling slighted
And I don't know
How to make it better make it better
You're dating other guys
You're telling me lies
Oh I can't believe
What I'm seeing with my eyes
I'm losing my mind
And I don't think It is clever think It is clever
You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal suicidal suicidal   
He said I'm worth it his one desire
I know things about 'em that you wouldn't wanna read about
He kissed me his one and only beautiful Liar
Tell me how you tolerate the things that you just found out about
You never know
Why are we the ones who suffer
I have to let go
He won't be the one to cry
Let's not kill the Karma
Let's not start a fight
It is not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it 
It is not worth our time
We can live without 'em
Just a beautiful liar
I trusted him but when I followed you I saw you together
I didn't know about you then Till I saw you with him again
I walked in on your love scene slow dancing
You stole everything how can you say I did you wrong
You never know
When the pain and heartbreak's over
I have to let go
The innocence is gone
Let's not kill the Karma
Let's not start a fight
It is not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it
It is not worth our time
We can live without 'em
Just a beautiful liar
Tell me how to forgive you
When It is me who's ashamed
And I wish could free you
Of the hurt and the pain
But the answer is simple
He's the one to blame
Let's not kill the Karma
Let's not start a fight
It is not worth the drama
For a beautiful liar
Can't we laugh about it
It is not worth our time
We can live without 'em
Just a beautiful liar
Far away I feel your beating heart 
All alone beneath the crystal stars 
Staring into space what a lonely face 
I will try to find my place with you 
What a beautiful smile 
Can I stay for awhile
On this beautiful night 
we will make everything right

Right now he's probably slow dancing with a bleach blonde tramp
And she's probably getting frisky
Right now he's probably buying her some fruity little drink
'Cause she can't shoot whiskey
Right now he's probably up behind her with a poolstick
Showing her how to shoot a combo
And he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Sslashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Right now she's probably up singing some whitetrash version of Shania Karaoke
Right now she's probably saying I'm drunk
And he's a thinking that he's gonna get lucky
Right now he's probably dabbing on three dollars worth of that bathroom Polo
And he don't know
That I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
I might saved a little trouble for the next girl
'Cause the next time that he cheats
Oh you know it won't be on me!
'Cause I dug my key into the side of his pretty little souped up four wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both headlights
Slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Ohhh maybe next time he'll think before he cheats
Ohhh before he cheats
I held the book so tightly in my hands
I saw your picture heard you call my name
It was strange I could not look away
I had to be there I wanted to go
You gave me no reason
you gave me no warning
But I was with you
by your side
Give me the strength so I can help you
And I can be strong now they don't frighten me
It is written in the book
The sun is hotter than before
But inside It is cold I wonder why
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm
Well I believe we can make it right
It is time now
to show our feelings
Looking through you
your heart's empty
Whatever happened to you you can't change it
Nowhere to run to please oh please don't let me down
But wait a minute I don't understand
It is getting stronger hold my hand
Don't want to leave you I don't want to go
But I'm a' losing all control
Can't you see me I'm slipping away
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here
Oh Lord
It is written in the book
I held the book so tightly in my hands
Saw your picture heard you call my name
Oh and even though we never never touched
I keep waiting for you just the same
La la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la
I wonder how I ever made it through a day 
How did I settle for a world in shades of gray 
When you go in circles all the scenery looks the same 
And you don't know why and I looked into your eyes 
Where the world stretched out in front of me and I realized 
I never lived before your love 
I never felt before your touch 
I never needed anyone to make me feel alive 
But then again I wasn't really living 
I never lived before your love 
I wanted more than just an ordinary life 
All of my dreams seemed like castles in the sky 
I stand before of you and my heart is in your hands 
And I don't know how I survived without you kiss 
'Cause you've given me a reason to exist 
And I don't know why 
Why the sun decides to shine 
But you breathed your love into me just in time 
When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It is easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't overflowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Spread your wings and fly
Butterfly

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend your baby your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say Bye no no no
Mamas daddies sisters brothers friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky 'cause we will never say Bye
As a child there were them times
I didn't get it but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
It is something more than saying I missed you
But when we talked too
All them grown folk things
Separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because
You loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
I wish I could find a way not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
It feels like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do is say Bye bye
Bye Bye 3x
Bye bye
And you never got the chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the Teddy Bear you gave me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong
That you can make it through whatever
It is so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever
bye bye bye bye bye bye 3x
Bye bye
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
I wish I could talk to you for a while
I wish I could find a way not to cry
As time goes by
And soon as you reach a better place
I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
It feels like you gone too soon
The hardest thing to do is say Bye bye
bye bye bye bye bye bye 3x

Makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now

The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers staying safe and warm

Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Wherever you go
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
And it starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feeling shows
'cause you make me smile baby
Just take your time now
Holdin' me tight
Wherever wherever wherever you go
Wherever wherever wherever you go
wherever you go
I always know
'Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while
Yeah
That's the way it is
You're bringing on the Heartache
Gypsy sittin' lookin' pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes
You're a mystery
Always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin for a feeling
But It is easy come and easy go
Oh I'm sorry but It is true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin all the best of me

Mmm hmm
How can you see into my eyes like open doors
Leading you down into my core
Where I've become so numb without a soul
My spirit sleeping somewhere cold 
Until you find it there and lead it back home
Wake me up
Wake me up inside
I can't wake up
Wake me up inside
Save me
Call my name and save me from the dark
Wake me up
Bid my blood to run
I can't wake up
before I come undone
Save me
Save me from the nothing I've become
Now that I know what I'm without
you can't just leave me
breathe into me and make me real
bring me to life
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie there's nothing inside
Bring me to life
Frozen inside without your touch without your love
Darling only you are the life among the dead
All this time I can't believe I couldn't see
Kept in the dark but you were there in front of me
I've been sleeping a thousand years it seems
Got to open my eyes to everything
Without a thought without a voice without a soul
Don't let me die here
There must be something more
Bring me to life
Bring me to life
I've been living a lie there's nothing inside
Bring me to life

Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know It is not all right
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight
Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again
I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know It is not all right
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight
I will paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I will never fight again
And this is how it ends
I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know It is not all right
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit 
Tonight
I'm breaking the habit
Im breaking the habit 
Tonight

Grew up in a small town
And when the rain would fall down
I just stared out my window
Dreaming of what could be
And if I'd end up happy
I would pray  I would pray
Trying not to reach out
But when I'd try to speak out
Felt like no one could hear me
Wanted to belong here
But something felt so wrong here
So I pray  I would pray
I could breakaway
I will spread my wings and I will learn how to fly
I will do what it takes till' I touch the sky
I will make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I will take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Wanna feel the warm breeze
Sleep under a palm tree
Feel the rush of the ocean
Get onboard a fast train
Travel on a jet plane far away I will
And breakaway
I will spread my wings and I will learn how to fly
I will do what it takes till' I touch the sky
I will make a wish 
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget all the ones that I loved
I will take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway
Buildings with a hundred floors
Swinging around revolving doors
Maybe I don't know where they'll take me but
Gotta keep moving on moving on
Fly away breakaway
I will spread my wings
And I will learn how to fly
Though It is not easy to tell you goodbye
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance
Make a change
And breakaway
Out of the darkness and into the sun
But I won't forget the place I come from
I gotta take a risk
Take a chance 
Make a change
And breakaway breakaway breakaway
What'cha been doing What'cha been doing
Whoa whoa
Haven't seen ya 'round
How you been feeling How you been feeling
Whoa whoa
Don't you bring me down
All that stuff about me
Being with him

All the lies that you told
Just to ease your own soul
But I'm bigger than that
No you don't have my back
No no ha
Hey how long Till the music drowns you out
Don't put words up in my mouth
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey how long Till you face what's going on
Cause you really got it wrong
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Well I'm sorry
That he called me
And that I answered the telephone
Don't be worried
I'm not with him
And when I go out tonight
I'm going home alone
Just got back from my tour
I'm a mess girl for sure
All I want is some fun
Guess that I'd better run
Hollywood sucks you in
But it won't spit me out
Whoa whoa ha
Hey how long Till the music drowns you out
Don't put words up in my mouth
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey how long Till you face what's going on
Cause you really got it wrong
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Please stop telling all your friends
I'm getting sick of them
Always staring at me like I took him from ya'
Hey how long Till the music drowns you out
Don't put words up in my mouth
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey how long Till you face what's going on
Cause you really got it wrong
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey how long till you look at your own life
Instead of looking into mine
I didn't steal your boyfriend
Hey how long till you're leaving me alone
Don't you got somewhere to go
I didn't steal your boyfriend
I walk a lonely road 
The only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes
But It is home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone I walk a
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone
I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge
And where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's up and every things all right
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive
And I walk alone
I walk alone I walk alone
I walk alone I walk a
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone
I walk this empty street
On the boulevard of broken dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk a
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Till then I walk alone

You got a reaction
You got a reaction didn't you
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid and turned it blue 
Something better than nothing
Something better than nothing's giving up
We all need to do something
Try to keep the truth from showing up 
How dare you
How old are you now anyway
How dare you
How old are you now anyway
How dare you
How old are you now anyway
You're given a flower
But I guess there's just no pleasing you
Your lip tastes sour
But you think It is just me teasing you 
You got a reaction
You got a reaction didn't you
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid and turned it blue 
Get behind me
Get behind me now anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now anyway
Get behind me
Get behind me now anyway
You got a reaction
You got a reaction didn't you
You took a white orchid
You took a white orchid and turned it blue 
Closed off from love
I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough
And it was all in vain
Time starts to pass
Before you know it you're frozen
But something happened
For the very first time with you
My heart melts into the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round
Thinking I'm going crazy
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open
Trying hard not to hear
But they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears
Try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that the goal
Is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater
Than the rush that comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness
I see your face
Yet everyone around me
Thinks that I'm going crazy maybe maybe
But I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open
And It is draining all of me
Oh they find it hard to believe
I will be wearing these scars
For everyone to see
I don't care what they say
I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away
But they don't know the truth
My heart's crippled by the vein
That I keep on closing
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
You cut me open and I
Keep bleeding
Keep keep bleeding love
Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
I fell in fear upon my back
I said don't look back just keep on walking
When the big black horse said look this way
He said Hey little lady will you marry me
But I said no no no nonono
It said no no you're not the one for me
No no no nonono
It said no no you're not the one for me
And my heart had a problem in the early hours
So it stopped it dead for a beat or two
But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done that
And it won't forgive me after all these years
So I sent it to a place in the middle of nowhere
With a big black horse and a cherry tree
Now it won't come back 'cause It is oh so happy
And now I've got a hole for the world to see
And it said no no no nonono
It said no no you're not the one for me
No no no nonono
No no you're not the one for me
Not the one for me
Said nono nono no no no no no nonono
You're not the one for me
Said nono nono no no no
You're not the one for me
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
Big black horse and a cherry tree
I can't quite get there 'cause my heart's forsaken me
Sheets of empty canvas untouched sheets of clay
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
All five horizons revolved around her soul
As the earth to the sun
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn
Oh and all I taught her was everything
Oh I know she gave me all that she wore
And now my bitter hands chafe beneath the clouds
Of what was everything
Oh the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything
I take a walk outside
I'm surrounded by some kids at play
I can feel their laughter so why do I sear
Oh and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
I'm spinning oh I'm spinning
How quick the sun can drop away
And now my bitter hands cradle broken glass
Of what was everything
All the pictures have all been washed in black tattooed everything
All the love gone bad turned my world to black
Tattooed all I see all that I am all I will ever be yeah
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life I know you'll be a sun
In somebody else's sky but why
Why why can't it be why can't it be mine
Huh huh huh no no no yeah
We belong we belong together together
We we belong we belong together
Oh yeah
The smell of your skin lingers on me now
Your probably on your flight back to your home town
I need some shelter of my own protection baby
To be with myself and center clarity
Peace serenity
I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It is personal myself and I
We have got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But Ive got to get a move on with my life
It is time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
The path that I'm walking
I must go alone
I must take the baby steps until I'm full grown
Fairy tales don't always have a happy ending do they
And I foresee the dark ahead if I stay
I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It is personal myself and I
We have got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It is time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Like the little school mate in the school yard
we will play jacks and uno cards
I will be your best friend and you'll be mine
Valentine
Yes you can hold my hand if you want to
Cause I want to hold yours too
we will be playmates and lovers and share our secret worlds
But It is time for me to go home
It is getting late dark outside
I need to be with myself and center clarity
Peace serenity
I hope you know I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It is personal Myself and I
We have got some straightenin' out to do
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
It is time to be a big girl now
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry	
Where I come from isn't all that great
My automobile is a piece of crap
My fashion sense is a little wack
And my friends are just as screwy as me
I didn't go to boarding schools
Preppy girls never looked at me
Why should they I ain't nobody
Got nothing in my pocket
Beverly Hills  that's where I want to be 
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Beverly Hills  rolling like a celebrity
Livin' in Beverly Hills
Look at all those movie stars
They're all so beautiful and clean
When the housemaids scrub the floors 
They get the spaces in between
I wanna live a life like that
I wanna be just like a King
Take my picture by the pool 
Cause I'm the next big thing!
The truth is I don't stand a chance
Its something that you're born into
And I just don't belong
No I don't 
I'm just a no class beat down fool
And I will always be that way
I might as well enjoy my life
And watch the stars play
I think you can do much better than me
After all the lies that I made you believe
Guilt kicks in and I start to see
The edge of the bed
Where your nightgown used to be
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
While looking through your old box of notes
I found those pictures I took
That you were looking for
If there's one memory I don't want to lose
That time at the mall
You and me in the dressing room
I told myself I won't miss you
But I remember
What it feels like beside you
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
The bed I'm lying in is getting colder
Wish I never would've said It is over
And I can't pretend I won't think about you when I'm older
Cause we never really had our closure
This can't be the end
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
I really miss your hair in my face
And the way your innocence tastes
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
And I think you should know this
You deserve much better than me
The sky is falling 
And It is early in the morning
But It is ok somehow
I spilt my coffee it went
All over your clothes
I gotta wear mine now
And im always alwaysalways late
And my hair's a mess 
Even when It is straight
But so what
I'm better off everyday
When i'm standing in the pouring rain I dont mind
I think of you and everythings alright
I used to think i had it good
But now i know that i misunderstood
With you I'd say i'm better off in every way
My friends keep callin'
They say they say im stallin' 
And they wanna meet you now
I tell them hell no i say
We're tryin' to lay low
Don't wanna lose what i've found
Things are finally finally lookin' up
Oh my feet are on the ground
Even though im stuck
But so what
I'm better off everyday
When i'm standing in the pouring rain I dont mind
I think of you and everythings alright
I used to think i had it good
But now i know that i misunderstood
With you I'd say i'm better off in every way
Things are finally finally lookin' up
Oh my feet are on the ground
Even though im stuck
Even though im stuck
But so what
I'm better off everyday
When i'm standing in the pouring rain I dont mind
I think of you and everythings alright
I used to think i had it good
But now i know that i misunderstood
With you I'd say i'm better off in every way
Yeah yeah 
Better off in every way
I'm better off in every way
I'm better off today
The sky is falling 
And It is early in the morning
But It is ok
Waitin' watchin' the clock It is four o'clock It is got to stop
Tell him take no more she practices her speech
As he opens the door she rolls over
Pretends to sleep as he looks over
She lies and says she's in love with him can't find a better man
She dreams in color she dreams in red can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Oh
Talkin' to herself there's no one else who needs to know
She tells herself oh
Memories back when she was bold and strong
And waiting for the world to come along
Swears she knew it now she swears he's gone
She lies and says she's in love with him can't find a better man
She dreams in color she dreams in red can't find a better man
She lies and says she still loves him can't find a better man
She dreams in color she dreams in red can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Can't find a better man
Yeah
She loved him yeah she don't want to leave this way
She needs him yeah that's why she'll be back again
Can't find a better man 
And you ask me what I want this year
And I try to make this kind and clear
Just a chance that maybe we will find better days
'Cause I don't need boxes wrapped in strings
And desire and love and empty things
Just a chance that maybe we will find better days
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
And It is someplace simple where we could live
And something only you can give
And that's faith and trust and peace while we're alive
And the one poor child that saved this world
And there's ten million more who probably could
If we all just stopped and said a prayer for them
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
I wish everyone was loved tonight
And somehow stop this fight
Just a chance that maybe we will find better days
So take these words
And sing out loud
'Cause everyone is forgiven now
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
'Cause tonight's the night the world begins again
Everybody's always talking at me
Everybody's trying to get in my head
I wanna listen to my own heart talking
I need to count on myself instead
Did you ever
Zac
Loose yourself to get what you want
Did you ever
Zac
Get on a ride and wanna get off
Did you ever
Zac
Push away the ones you should've held close
Did you ever let go
Did you ever not know
I'm not gonna stop that's who I am
I will give it all I got that is my plan
Will I find what I lost
You know you can
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on me
I wanna make it right that is the way
To turn my life around today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
How will I know if there's a path worth taking
Should I question every move I make
With all I've lost my heart is breaking
I don't wanna make the same mistake
Did you ever
Zac
Doubt your dream will ever come true
Did you ever
Zac
Blame the world and never blame you
 I will never
Zac
Try to live a lie again
I don't wanna win this game if I can't play it my way
I'm not gonna stop that's who I am
Who I am
I will give it all I got that is my plan
That's my plan
Will I find what I lost
You know you can
You know you can
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on me
I wanna make it right that is the way
To turn my life around today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
OhHold up
Give me room to think
Bring it on down
Gotta work on my swing
Gotta do my own thing
Hold up
It is no good at all
To see yourself and not recognize your face
Out on my own It is such a scary place
The answers are all inside of me
All I gotta do is believe
I'm not gonna stop
Not gonna stop Till I get my shot
That's who I am that is my plan
Will I end up on top
You can bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
You can bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
I wanna make it right that is the way
To turn my life around today is the day
Am I the type of guy who means what I say
Bet on it bet on it
Bet on it bet on it
You can bet on me
So you sailed away
Into a gray sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring 
Nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now 
But It is not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had 
So you stole my world
Now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl
Leaves me down and lonely 
Send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better 
And it may take some time to
Patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I
Run away and hide
And I may find in time that
You were always right
You're always right 
So you sailed away
Into a gray sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring 
What was it you wanted
Could it be I'm haunted 
But It is not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back
You're just the best I ever had 
You're just the best I ever had 
You're just the best I ever had 
The best I ever   
I've given up on giving up slowly I'm blending in so 
You won't even know me apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention is my one last shot at redemption 
Because I know to live you must give your life away
And I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
I've been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there's no way in knowing where to go promise I'm going because
I gotta get outta here 
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here 
And I'm begging you I'm begging you I'm begging you to be my escape
I'm giving up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how
He's told me the way and I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving 
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair
'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and
I've been locked inside that house all the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there's no way in knowing where to go promise I'm going because
I gotta get outta here 
Cause I'm afraid that this complacency is something I can't shake
I gotta get outta here 
And I'm begging You I'm begging You I'm begging You to be my escape 
I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self detained and forced to live in this mess I've made
And all I'm  is for You to do what You can with me
But I can't ask You to give what You already gave 
Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
I fought You for so long
I should have let You in
Oh how we regret those things we do
And all I was trying to do was save my own skin
But so were You
Seems like just yesterday
You were a part of me
I used to stand so tall
I used to be so strong
Your arms around me tight
Everything it felt so right
Unbreakable like nothin' could go wrong
Now I can't breathe
No I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Here I am once again
I'm torn into pieces
Can't deny it can't pretend
Just thought you were the one
Broken up deep inside
But you won't get to see the tears I cry
Behind these hazel eyes
I told you everything
Opened up and let you in
You made me feel all right
For once in my life
Now all that's left of me
Is what I pretend to be
So together but so broken up inside
'Cause I can't breathe
No I can't sleep
I'm barely hanging on
Swallow me then spit me out
For hating you I blame myself
Seeing you it kills me now
No I don't cry on the outside
Anymore
Lord almighty
I feel my temperature rising
Lord help me
Feel like I'm slipping away
It is hard to breathe 
and my chest is a heaving
Yeah
Lord almighty
I'm burning a hole where I lay
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
and you light my morning sky
With burning love
Ooh ooh ooh
I feel my temperature rising
Higher Higher
Feel like I'm slipping away
It is hard to breathe 
and my chest is a heaving
Lord almighty
I'm burning a hole where I lay
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like a sweet song of a choir
And you light my morning sky
With burning love
Ah It is coming closer
The flames are now licking my body
Please won't you help me
Feel like I'm slipping away
It is hard to breathe
And my chest is aheaving
Lord almighty
I'm burning a hole where I lay
Yeah
Cause your kisses lift me higher
Like the sweet song of a choir
You light my morning sky
With burning love
With burning love
Burning love
Ah burning love
I'm just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Ah
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
I'm just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Ah
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love
Just a hunk a hunk of burning love 
Hey where did we go 
Days when the rains came 
Down in the hollow 
Playing a new game 
Laughing and a running hey hey 
Skipping and a jumping 
In the misty morning fog with 
Our our hearts a thumping and you 
My brown eyed girl 
You my brown eyed girl  
Whatever happened 
To Tuesday and so slow 
Going down the old mine 
With a transistor radio 
Standing in the sunlight laughing 
Hiding behind a rainbow's wall
Slipping and sliding 
All along the waterfall with you 
My brown eyed girl 
You my brown eyed girl  
Do you remember when we used to sing 
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da 
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da
La tee da
So hard to find my way 
Now that I'm all on my own  
I saw you just the other day 
My how you have grown 
Cast my memory back there Lord 
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about 
Making love in the green grass 
Behind the stadium with you 
My brown eyed girl 
You my brown eyed girl 
Do you remember when we used to sing 
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da 
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da 
Sha la la la la la la la la la la tee da 
I wanted you to know I love the way you laugh
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away
I keep your photograph and I know it serves me well
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
You've gone away you don't feel me anymore
The worst is over now and we can breathe again
I wanna hold you high you steal my pain away
There's so much left to learn and no one left to fight
I wanna hold you high and steal your pain
'Cause I'm broken when I'm open 
And I don't feel like I am strong enough
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
'Cause I'm broken when I'm lonesome
And I don't feel right when you're gone away
You've gone away
You don't feel me here anymore
There you are 
Looking as fine as can be 
In your fancy car 
I can tell you're looking at me 
What you wanna do 
Are you just gonna sit there and stare 
Baby talk to me 
Tell me what's on your mind 
Baby oh
Oh baby bring it all to me 
But I don't need no fancy cars or diamond rings 
Oh baby bring it all to me 
Bring me your time your love your space your energy
Baby what's the deal 
Would it be too forward if I 
Told you how I feel 
That's just the way I do my thing 
So for real 
Are you feeling my Tim's my baggy jeans my thug appeal 
Do you like it when a man can keep it real oh

inside

Cause It is you I need every day and night
Oh baby yeah

When tears are in your eyes I will dry them all
I'm on your side  When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down 
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down 
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you 
I will take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down 
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down 
Sail on silvergirl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way
See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
I can feel the magic floatin' in the air
Being with you gets me that way
I watch the sunlight dance across your face and I
I've never been this swept away
All my thoughts just seem to settle on the breeze
When I'm lying wrapped up in your arms
The whole world just fades away the only thing I hear 
Is the beating of your heart
And I can feel you breathe It is washing over me
Suddenly I'm melting into you
There's nothing left to prove baby all we need is just to be
Caught up in the touch slow and steady rush 
And baby isn't that the way love's supposed to be
I can feel you breathe
Just breathe
In a way I know my heart is waking up
As all the walls come tumblin' down
Closer that I've ever felt before and I know and you know
There's no need for words right now
I can feel the magic floatin' in the air
Being with you gets me that way 
If I was your boyfriend I'd never let you go

Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me 
Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo Galileo figaro 
Magnifico

Nothing really matters Anyone can see

Any way the wind blows
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May her tender sighs
Love was ours
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left gone was the glow of
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet
Through my tears
You've got a thing or two to learn about me baby 
'Cause I ain't taking it no more and I don't mean maybe 
You don't know right from wrong

Just hold on tight now baby
Hold on 
I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holding you
Were you born to resist or be abused
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Are you gone and onto someone new
I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I will never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Has someone taken your faith
It is real the pain you feel
You trust you must confess
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Has someone taken your faith
It is real the pain you feel
The life the love
You die to heal
The hope that starts
The broken hearts
You trust you must confess
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
I've got another confession my friend
I'm no fool
I'm getting tired of starting again
Somewhere new
Were you born to resist or be abused
I swear I will never give in
I refuse
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
Has someone taken your faith
It is real the pain you feel
You trust you must confess
Is someone getting the best the best the best the best of you
You get the limo out front
Have the styles every shoe every color
Yea when you're famous it can be kinda fun
Its really you but no one ever discovers
In some ways you're just like all your friends
But on stage you're a star
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that It is the best of both worlds
The best of both worlds
You go the movie premiers 
Hear your songs on the radio
Living two lives is a little weird
But schools cool 'cause nobody knows
Yea you get to be a small town girl
But big time when you play your guitar
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that It is the best of both
You know the best of both worlds
Pictures and autographs
You get your face in all the magazines
The best parts that you get to be who ever you wanna be
Yea best of both
You get the best of both
Come on best of both
Who would of thought that a girl like me
Would double as a superstar
You get the best of both worlds
Chill it out take it slow
Then you rock out the show
You get the best of both worlds
Mix it all together and you know that It is the best of both worlds
You get the best of both worlds
Without the shades and the hair
You can go anywhere
You get the best of both girls
Mix it all together
Oh yeah
It is so much better cuz you know you've got the best of both worlds   
So you sailed away
Into a gray sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring 
Nothing's quite the same now
I just say your name now 
But It is not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
You don't want me back
You're just the best I ever had 
So you stole my world
Now I'm just a phony
Remembering the girl
Leaves me down and lonely 
Send it in a letter
Make yourself feel better 
And it may take some time to
Patch me up inside
But I can't take it so I
Run away and hide
And I may find in time that
You were always right
You're always right 
So you sailed away
Into a gray sky morning
Now I'm here to stay
Love can be so boring 
What was it you wanted
Could it be I'm haunted 
But It is not so bad
You're only the best I ever had
I don't want you back
You're just the best I ever had 
You're just the best I ever had 
You're just the best I ever had 
The best I ever had
The night we met I knew I
Needed you so
And if I had the chance I'd
Never let you go
So won't you say you love me
I will make you so proud of me
we will make them turn their heads
Every place we go
So won't you please
Be my be my baby Be my little baby
My one and only baby Save me my darling
Be my be my baby Be my baby now
My one and only baby Woahohohohh
I will make you happy baby
Just wait and see
For every kiss you give me

Oh since the day I saw you
I have been waiting for you
You know I will adore you
Until eternity

Be my be my baby Be my baby now
My one and only baby Woahohohohh
I've given up on giving up slowly I'm blending in so 
You won't even know me apart from this whole world that shares my fate
This one last bullet you mention is my one last shot at redemption 
Because I know to live you must give your life away
And I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
I've been locked inside that house all the while You hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there's no way in knowing where to go promise I'm going because
I gotta get outta here 
I'm stuck inside this rut that I fell into by mistake
I gotta get outta here 
And I'm begging you I'm begging you I'm begging you to be my escape
I'm giving up on doing this alone now
'Cause I've failed and I'm ready to be shown how
He's told me the way and I'm trying to get there
And this life sentence that I'm serving
I admit that I'm every bit deserving 
But the beauty of grace is that it makes life not fair
'Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
I've been locked inside that house all the while you hold the key
And I've been dying to get out and that might be the death of me
And even though there's no way in knowing where to go promise I'm going because
I gotta get outta here 
Cause I'm afraid that this complacency is something I can't shake
I gotta get outta here 
And I'm begging You I'm begging You I'm begging You to be my escape
I am a hostage to my own humanity
Self detained and forced to live in this mess I've made
And all I'm g is for You to do what You can with me
But I can't ask You to give what You already gave 
Cause I've been housing all this doubt and insecurity and 
I fought You for so long
I should have let You in
Oh how we regret those things we do
And all I was trying to do was save my own skin
But so were You
For all those times you stood by me 
For all the truth that you made me see 
For all the joy you brought to my life 
For all the wrong that you made right 
For every dream you made come true 
For all the love I found in you 
I will be forever thankful baby 
You're the one who held me up 
Never let me fall 
You're the one who saw me through through it all 
You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
You gave me wings and made me fly 
You touched my hand I could touch the sky
I lost my faith you gave it back to me 
You said no star was out of reach 
You stood by me and I stood tall 
I had your love I had it all 
I'm grateful for each day you gave me 
Maybe I don't know that much 
But I know this much is true 
I was blessed because I was loved by you 
You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
You were always there for me 
The tender wind that carried me 
A light in the dark shining your love into my life
You've been my inspiration 
Through the lies you were the truth
My world is a better place because of you
You were my strength when I was weak 
You were my voice when I couldn't speak 
You were my eyes when I couldn't see 
You saw the best there was in me 
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach 
You gave me faith 'coz you believed 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me 
I'm everything I am 
Because you loved me
There was a time when I used to run away
Anytime I started to fall
Cause love's never been very kind to me no baby
Not very kind at all
Until you 
You stole my heart away
Somehow you helped restore my faith
And something I thought wasn't for me
Now comes so easily
Because I love you
You're the flame that sets my soul on fire
That special girl I pray for every night
That pretty melody
That plays over and over again in my head
Because I love you
Forever stare at you and never get tired
Honey I'm ready to spend my whole life with you
Cause I love you 
Yes I do
I never thought in a million years
That I could feel the way that I feel no
How I get butterflies get butterflies
Whenever your lips touch mine
I must confess my dear
That it was instantly right from the start
A special bond between you and my heart
How it skips a beat whenever our eyes meet
And simply said the reason being 
Because I love you
You're the flame that sets my soul on fire
That special girl I pray for every night
That pretty melody
That plays over and over again in my head
Cause I love you
Forever stare at you and never get tired
Honey I'm ready to spend my whole life with you
I will say it again
I love you yes I do
Girl I know there'll be differences we have along the way
Where our views may not always be the same
But I swear I will try 
To hear out your sigh
And compromise cuz I realize
That with you I wanna spend my life
Because I love you
You're the flame that sets my soul on fire
That special girl I pray for every night
That pretty melody
That plays over and over again in my head
Because I love you
Forever stare at you and never get tired
Honey I'm ready to spend my whole life with you
Girl It is all because
I love you 
There was a time when I used to run away
Anytime I started to fall
Cause love's never been very kind to me no baby
Not very kind at all
Until you 
You stole my heart away
Somehow you helped restore my faith
And something I thought wasn't for me
Now comes so easily
Because I love you
You're the flame that sets my soul on fire
That special girl I pray for every night
That pretty melody
That plays over and over again in my head
Because I love you
Forever stare at you and never get tired
Honey I'm ready to spend my whole life with you
Cause I love you 
Yes I do
I never thought in a million years

Girl It is all because
I love you 
Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends 
Then somebody bends unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
Ever just as sure as the sun will rise
Tale as old as time
Tune as old as song
Bitter sweet and strange 
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the beast
In the sunlight of your smile
In the summer of our life
In the magic of love
Storms above scattered away
Lovers dreaming in the night
Reaching for paradise
But as the dark shadows fade
Love slips away
On an empty stretch of beach
In the pattern of the waves
Drawing pictures with my hand
In the sand I see your face
Skipping pebbles on the sea
Wishing for paradise
Sand castles crumble below
The restless tides ebb and flow
Listening to a shell
Hoping for your voice
Beautiful Maria of my soul
Though we will always be apart
Locked forever in a dream
If I ever love again
Even then nothing will change
And the taste of you remains
Clinging to paradise
But as the distance from you grows
All that my heart ever knows
Hunger for your kiss
Longing for your touch
Beautiful Maria of my soul
Filling all my nights
Haunting all my days
Beautiful Maria of my soul
It is undeniable  that we should be together
It is unbelievable how I used to say that I'd fall never
The basis is need to know if you don't know  just how I feel
Then let me show you now that I'm for real
If all things in time time will reveal
Yeah 
One you're like a dream come true
Two jus wanna be with you
Three girl It is plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four  steps one through three
Five make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done 
then I start Back at One yeah
So incredible the way things work themselves out
And all emotional once you know that its all about babe
And undesirable for us to be apart
Never would have made it very far 
Cause you know that you got the keys to my 
One you're like a dream come true
Two jus wanna be with you
Three girl It is plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four  steps one through three
Five make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done 
then I start Back at One 
Say farewell to the dark night 
I see the coming of the sun
I feel like a little child whose life has just begun
You came and reached into the light
Into this lonely heart of mine
You threw out the life line  
just in the Nick of Time
One you're like a dream come true
Two jus wanna be with you
Three girl It is plain to see that you're the only one for me and
Four  steps one through three
Five make you fall in love with me
If ever I believe my work is done 
then I start Back at One 
Friday night I'm going nowhere
All the lights are changing green to red
Turning over TV stations
Situations running through my head
Well looking back through time
You know It is clear that I've been blind
I've been a fool
To ever open up my heart
To all that jealousy that bitterness that ridicule
Saturday I'm running wild
And all the lights are changing red to green
Moving through the crowd I'm pushing
Chemicals all rushing through my bloodstream
Only wish that you were here
You know I'm seeing it so clear
I've been afraid
To tell you how I really feel
Admit to some of those bad mistakes I've made
If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Babylon Babylon
Sunday all the lights of London
Shining sky is fading red to blue
I'm kicking through the Autumn leaves
And wondering where it is you might be going to
Turning back for home
You know I'm feeling so alone
I can't believe
Climbing on the stair
I turn around to see you smiling there
In front of me
If you want it
Come and get it
Crying out loud
The love that I was
Giving you was
Never in doubt
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Let go your heart
Let go your head
And feel it now
Babylon Babylon Babylon 
Don't you remember
The fizz in a pepper
Peanuts in a bottle
At ten two and four
A fried bologna sandwich
With mayo and tomato
Sitting round the table
Don't happen much anymore
We got too complicated
It is all way overrated
I like the old and out dated
Way of life
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I love my records
Black shiny vinyl
Clicks and pops
And white noise
Man they sounded fine
I had my favorite stations
The ones that played them all
Country soul and rock and roll
What happened to those times 
I'm reading Street Slang For Dummies
Cause they put pop in my country
I want more for my money
The way it was Back When
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
Give me a flat top for strumming
I want the whole world to be humming
Just keep it coming
The way it was Back When
Back when a hoe was a hoe
Coke was a coke
And crack's what you were doing
When you were cracking jokes
Back when a screw was a screw
The wind was all that blew
And when you said I'm down with that
Well it meant you had the flu
I miss back when
I miss back when
I miss back when
I will not make the same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break the way you did
You fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And It is not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because you know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life because It is empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you
It was written that I would love you
From the moment I opened my eyes
And the morning when I first saw you
Gave me life under calico skies
I will hold you for as long as you like
I will hold you for the rest of my life
Always looking for ways to love you
Never failing to fight at your side
While the angels of love protect us
From the innermost secrets we hide
I will hold you for as long as you like
I will hold you for the rest of my life
Long live all us crazy soldiers 
Who were born under calico skies
May we never be called to handle
All the weapons of war we despise
I will hold you for as long as you like
I will hold you for the rest of my life
I will hold you for as long as you like
I will hold you for the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
If I was in L A
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
Stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Oh I got down on my knees
And I pretend to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold  
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown
And the sky is gray
I've been for a walk
On a winter's day
If I didn’t tell her
I could leave today
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
California dreaming
On such a winter's day
