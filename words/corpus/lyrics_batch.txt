Well I got a reaction.
And Im in love.
I just think about you.
But I lost my mind.
Youre skin and bones Im a do my very best.
Im on your flight back to me.
All the homes that we may start anew.
Im just a silly place.
Right now shes probably saying Im sorry for that night.
No I cant pretend I wont let another minute go to waste.
Im comfortable enough to feel the need for company.
Breathe breathe on me.
And I try to go to boarding schools.
Im gonna give you what he loves me.
