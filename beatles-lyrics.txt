Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
"Love will find a way"?
Gather 'round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Well I'm the Sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
Well at night when you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep
The stars that shine above
Will light our way to love
You rule this world with me
I'm the Sheik of Araby
Well I'm the Sheik of Araby
Your love belongs to me
Oh at night when you're asleep
Into your tent I'll creep
The sun that shines above
Will light our way to love
You rule this world with me
I'm the Sheik of Araby
Well I'm the Sheik of Araby
Well I'm the Sheik of Araby, yeah

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
I met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
(Instrumental) 
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling
It's been a long, cold lonely winter
Little darling
It feels like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Little darling
The smiles returning to the faces
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been here
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes
Little darling
I feel that ice is slowly melting
Little darling
It seems like years since it's been clear
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun
It's all right
It's all right
I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?
You don't look different
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Your lips are moving
I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing
But the words aren't clear
You don't sound different
I've learned the game
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Why, tell me why
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me
The same old way
You were above me
But not today
The only difference
Is you're down there
I'm looking through you
And you're nowhere
Why, tell me why
Did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit
Of disappearing overnight
I'm looking through you
Where did you go?
I thought I knew you
What did I know?
You don't look different
But you have changed
I'm looking through you
You're not the same
Yeah, oh, baby you've changed
Aah, I'm a-looking through you
Yeah, I'm looking through you
You've changed, you've changed
You've changed, you've changed
To lead a better life I need my home to be here...
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speking but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
To be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere
You Never Give Me Your Money
You only give me your paper
And in the middle of negotiations you break down
I never give you my number
I only give my situation
And in the middle of investigation I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But, oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Yes it did (na, na)
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
Ah
Here come the Sun King
Here come the Sun King
Everybody's laughing
Everybody's happy
Here come the Sun King

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy him some clothes
Keeps a ten bob note up his nose
Such a dirty old man
His sister Pam works in the shop
She doesn't stop; she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking, but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
Who makes the News Of The World
Yes, you could say that she's attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(John) She's coming in the house
(Paul) Oh, look out!
She Came In Through The Bathroom Window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wonders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though I thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
Although she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
Oh, yeah
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way
To get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep, pretty darling; do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden Slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep. pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby.
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
I never give you my pillow
I only give you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
Boy, you're gonna Darry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna Carry That Weight
Carry That Weight a long time
Oh yeah!
All right!
Are you going to be in my dreams tonight?
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
And, in The End
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I got to get a bellyful of wine
Her majesty's a real nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm going to make her mine
If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more, it's true
Yes it is
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is, oh, yes it is, yea
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is, oh, yes it is, yea
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you
Treasure these few words 'till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S., I love you
You, you, you
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'till the day I do, love
P.S., I love you
You, you, you
As I write this letter
Send my love to you
Remember that I'll always
Be in love with you
Treasure these few words 'till we're together
Keep all my love forever
P.S., I love you
You, you, you
As I write this letter
(Oh)
Send my love to you
(You know I want you to)
Remember that I'll always
(Yeah)
Be in love with you
I'll be coming home again to you, love
And 'till the day I do, love
P.S., I love you
You, you, you
You, you, you
I love you
That boy took my love away
Oh, he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
Till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy, this boy
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world
To see we've met
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm mmm mmm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
La, di, di, da di di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
And kept out of sight
For other girls were never quite like this
La, di, di, da di di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm, mmm, mmm, la di di
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
Oh, falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
Me back again
I want to tell you
My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up and I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got time

When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
And when the brokenhearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted
There is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer let it be
Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom

There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music

A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey, and you
Yours was a kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back
(He'll come back)
For the honey
(For the honey)
And you
(Instrumental) 
Look what you're doing
I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please, stop your lying
You've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you
Wondering what you're gonna do
And should you need a love that's true
It's me
Please, stop your lying
You've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me
What you're doing to me

My Michelle
You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize
As I looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh, yes you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
But when you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you

And they seem to say
You have broken my heart
(Oh, twist and shout!)
Don't go away

Asked a girl what she wanted to be
She said, "Baby, can't you see?
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between"
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
I told that girl that my prospects were good
And she said, "Baby, it's understood

Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know I need someone
Help!
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?

Boys! And what I was thinking was, er ... would you like to do a number with us, you know, we'd like to do a number together
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You fancy that? Great!
Yeah-eh! It's the Kay sisters, they've come! Great! Fabulous!
The Kay sisters?! This is... 
Look, they've dyed their hair!
this is the Beatles!
Hello, Beatle! Where is he?
Where is he?
There he is! Hello, Bongo! Hey.
That's Ringo!
Oh, is he there as well? ... oh dear
Boys!
By golly!
As you can gather this is Eric. Say hello to Eric.
Yes.
Hello, Eric!
Hello, mate!
I remember you, you're the one with the short fat hairy legs!
No, no, no. It's... no, he's the one with the short fat hairy legs. No, him.
Yeah.
We're the ones with the big fat hairy heads. Get out of that!
[George puts his hand (opened flat, palm down, under Eric M's chin when saying "Get out of that".)
That was Eric's trick on Ernie (a running gag).
"Get out of that, eh? You can't can you!!". 
If that's not funny to you, you had to be there!]
Hey! Hey-hey! What's it like being famous?
Well, it's not like in your day, you know.
[John, insulting them, by saying they are oldies with this remark!
Makes a gesture of "very far away" with his hands]
Ha! That was an insult, that is!
You didn't expect that, did you?
No!
What do you mean "not like in my day"?
Well, me dad used to tell me about you, you know.
[John indicated with his hand how tall he was, when his Dad told him ... just a little kid.
Eric misunderstands (deliberately) ...
In the old days.
You've only got a little dad have you?
Yer dad used to tell yer, that's a bit strong, innit? Alright, Bonzo!
That's Ringo!
Yeah, him as well!
Get 'em off, you've done enough.
[Pretending their "time slot" is up, get them off the stage, or done enough damage with their behaviour]
What do you mean "done enough"?
No, well I'm getting insulted now ...
No. Look, what I was going to suggest was let's do a number with the boys!
Oh yes! One that the dad will remember. That I used to do, with your dad. 
You go and get changed.
Yes, I will, right.
What do you think we should do, boys? What about something that's more suitable for Eric's age?
"Moonlight Bay".
"Moonlight Bay".
Yeah.
Sheepdog standing in the rain
Bullfrog doing it again
Some kind of happiness is
Measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
Something special when you smile?
Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence is
Measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
To listen to you fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
Big man walking in the park
Wigwam frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude is
Measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely, you can talk to me

Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it.
What is it?
It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead.
Oh!
It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all.
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice.
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school."
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella. 
I listen for your footsteps coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it, does it mean you don't love me anymore?
I hear the clock a ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a moving but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me anymore?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling I love only you
You never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass my by, don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late about an hour or two
I said that's all right, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass my by, don't make me cry
One two three four five six seven eight
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know darling I love only you
You never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass my by, don't make me cry
If the rain comes they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes, if the rain comes
When the sun shines they slip into the shade
(When the sun shines down)
And sip their lemonade
(When the sun shines down)
When the sun shines, when the sun shines
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
I can show you that when it starts to rain
(When the rain comes down)
Everything's the same
(When the rain comes down)
I can show you, I can show you
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
Can you hear me that when it rains and shines
(When it rains and shines)
It's just a state of mind?
(When it rains and shines)
Can you hear me, can you hear me?

You tell me that you've got everything you want
And your bird can sing
But you don't get me
You don't get me
You say you've seen the seven wonders
And you bird is green
But you can't see me
You can't see me
When your prized possessions
Start to weigh you down
Look in my direction
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
When your bird is broken
Will it bring you down?
You may be awoken
I'll be 'round, I'll be 'round
You tell me that you've heard every sound there is
And your bird can swing
But you can't hear me
You can't hear me
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like a rolling stone
Like the FBI and the CIA
And the BBC, BB King
And Doris Day, Matt Busby

If you want it
Here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it
Anytime I can give it
But you better hurry
'Cos it may not last
Did I hear you say
That there must be a catch?
Will you walk away
From a fool and his money
If you want it
Here it is
Come and get it
But you better hurry
'Cos it's going fast
If you want it
Here it is
Come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it
Anytime I can give it
But you'd better hurry
'Cos it may not last
Did I hear you say
That there must be a catch
Will you walk away
From a fool and his money?
Sonny, if you want it
Here it is
Come and get it
But you'd better hurry
'Cos it's going fast
You'd better hurry
'Cos it's going fast
Fool and his money

'Cos it's going fast
You'd better hurry
'Cos it's going fast
You'd better hurry
'Cos it's going fast
If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I'd lost my one and only
They'd be sad, if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin'
If they heard from the breeze that you left me cryin'
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'coz you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Coz they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'coz you told me so
And I've no intention of lettin' you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Coz they know that I've got my one and only
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me
They'll be glad, you're not bad to me, to me, to me
I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine
My happiness dear makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry
It's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I can't believe, it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I love you
'Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true
That it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I can't believe, it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you, you, you
Wednesday morning at five o'clock
As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen
clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the back door key
Stepping outside she is free
She
(We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving
(Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home
(We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone for
(Bye bye)
So many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
Daddy our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?
She
(We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving
(Never a thought for ourselves)
Home
(We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone for
(Bye bye)
So many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
She
(What did we do that was wrong?)
Is having
(We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun
(Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied for
(Bye bye)
So many years
She's leaving home
(Bye bye)
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry, it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then, you're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you, yeah
And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry, it's through, oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then, you're back again
No, no, no, not a second time
Not a second time
Not a second time
No no no no no
Not a second time
(Oh no no)
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there
If you need somebody to love
Just look into my eyes
I'll be there to make you feel right
If you're feeling sorry and sad
I'd really sympathize
Don't you be sad, just call me tonight
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there
If the sun has faded away
I'll try to make it shine
There is nothing I won't do
When you need a shoulder to cry on
I hope it will be mine
Call me tonight and I'll come to you
Any time at all
Any time at all
Any time at all
All you gotta do is call

All you gotta do is call
And I'll be there
Have you seen the old man in the closed down market,
kicking up the paper with worn out shoes ?
In his eyes you see no pride, and held loosely at his side,
Yesterday's paper telling yesterday's news.
So how can you tell me you're lonely, and say, for you that the sun don't shine ?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you though the streets of London,
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.
Have you seen the old girl who walks to the streets of London,
dirt in her hair and her clothes just in rags?
She's no time for talking, she just keeps right on walking,
Carrying here home in two carrier bags
So how can you tell me you're lonely, and say, for you that the sun don't shine ?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you though the streets of London,
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.
In the all-night cafe at a quarter past eleven,
same old man sitting there on his ownLooking at the world over the rim of him tea-cup,
Each tea lasts an hour, then he wanders home alone.
So how can you tell me you're lonely, and say, for you that the sun don't shine ?
Let me take you by the hand and lead you though the streets of London,
I'll show you something to make you change your mind.
I'm gonna search this town, 
from door to door. 
The love I crave 
I can't find no more. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I ain't had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye. 
You know I hate to see the sun 
sinking to the west, 
'cos I know my whole life's 
gonna be one solid mess. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I ain't had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye. 
Well ever since the day 
that she said we were through, 
I've been nervous 
and shook up too. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye. 
Well I don't care if the last thing 
I ever do in my life, 
is to find that little woman 
make her my wife. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye.
All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Now they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's weaving it
Coming on strong all the time
All through the day I me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through the day I me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
I me me mine
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine

Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life I me mine
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why'd she have to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
I get high when I see you go by, my oh my
When you sigh my, my inside just flies, butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight, every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright, very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you
Loving you
I don't like you 
But I love you 
See that I'm always 
thinking of you 
Oh, oh, oh, 
you treat me badly 
I love you madly 
You really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me, baby 
I don't want you, 
but I need you 
Don't want to kiss you 
but I need you 
Oh, oh, oh 
you do me wrong now 
my love is strong now 
You really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me, baby 
I love you and all I want you to do 
is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me 
I want to leave you 
don't want to stay here 
Don't want to spend 
another day here 
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now 
I just can quit now 
You really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me, baby 
I love you and all I want you to do 
is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me 
You really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me
Words are flowing out
Like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass
They slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow waves of joy
Are drifting through my open mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light
Which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind
Inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way
Across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter shades of earth
Are ringing through my open views
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love
Which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva

Well that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah that'll be the day when you make me cry
Ah, you say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Well you give me all your loving and all your turtledove-ing
All your hugs and kisses and your money too
You say you love me baby and still you tell me baby
That someday well I'll be through
'Cause that'll be the day when you make me cry

So if we'll ever part and I'll leave too
And you say you'll call me and you tell me boldly
That some day well I'll be through
'Cause that'll be the day when you say goodbye
Yeah that'll be the day when you make me cry
Ah, you say you're gonna leave, you know it's a lie
'Cause that'll be the day when I die
Yeah that'll be the day, hoo hoo

You are so sweet

I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling, don't ever let me go
Loving you
Is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

The leaves of brown came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out just like a light
Remember in September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems to play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring, to me it's still September
Oh, that September in the rain
To every word of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems to play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring, to me it's still September
Oh, that September in the rain
I said, I said it's September in the rain
Ah, September in the rain

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her
But she only thinks of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?

The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey!
I'll be on my way, ooh
I'll be on my way, ooh
I'll be on my way
I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
(Instrumental)
Temperature's rising
Fever is high
Can't see no future
Can't see no sky
My feet are so heavy
So is my head
I wish I was a baby
I wish I was dead
Cold turkey has got me on the run
My body is aching
Goose-pimple bone
Can't see no body
Leave me alone
My eyes are wide open
Can't get to sleep
One thing I'm sure of
I'm in at the deep freeze
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Thirty-six hours
Rolling in pain
Praying to someone
Free me again
Oh I'll be a good boy
Please make me well
I promise you anything
Get me out of this hell
Cold turkey has got me on the run
Oh, oh, oh, oh
What would you think if I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, I get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry you to be alone?
How do I feel by the end of the day
Are you sad because you're on your own?
No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?
I just need someone to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm, gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh, I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes, I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
She's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh, yeah
She's well acquainted
With the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the
Multicolored mirrors on his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes
While his hands are busy working overtime
A soap impression of his wife
Which he ate and donated to the National Trust
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Mother Superior jump the gun
Mother Superior jump the gun

Happiness is a warm gun

When I hold you in my arms
(Oh yeah)
And I feel my finger on your trigger

I know nobody can do me no harm
(Ooo, oh yeah)
Because happiness is a warm gun mama
(Bang bang, shoot shoot)
Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is

Well, don't you know that happiness is a warm gun mama
(Happiness is a warm gun yeah)
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her

It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes
You love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
Floating down the stream of time
From life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
Or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun
Where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
And get me home for tea
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
And what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
It's all too much
It's too much
It's too much
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much, ah
We are dead[Incomprehensible]
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Too much
Ã¢Â¦

That I still love you so
But if he loves you more
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you

But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Anna, just one more thing girl
You give back your ring to me
And I will set you free
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you

But every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

And I will set you free
Go with him

The world is treating me bad
Misery

Who never used to cry
The world is treatin' me bad
Misery
I've lost her now for sure
I won't see here no more
It's gonna be a drag
Misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
Can't she see she'll always be the only one, only one?
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
I'll remember all the little things we've done
She'll remember and she'll miss her only one, lonely one
Send her back to me
'Cause everyone can see
Without her I will be
In misery
Oh, ooo, ooo in misery
Ooo, my misery
La, la, la, la, la, la
Misery

Listen, do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell, whoa, oh
Closer, let me whisper in your ear

Nobody knows, just we two
Listen, do you want to know a secret?
Do you promise not to tell, whoa, oh
Closer, let me whisper in your ear
Say the words you long to hear
I'm in love with you, ooo, ooo
Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
'Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right
Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so
Wake up in the morning I don't feel blue
'Cause I know I got you
Get a funny feeling all day and night
I get the funny feeling you don't treat me right
Should have read your letters
And then I'd know
I would have felt much better
Because I know you love me so
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be?
And have you traveled very far?
Far as the eye can see
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there?
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
How does it feel to be
One of the beautiful people?
Tuned to a natural E
Happy to be that way
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
He keeps all his money in a big brown bag
Inside a zoo, what a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
(Beatles were never recorded this song, this made Peter and Gordon)
Nobody I know could love me more than you.
You can give me so much love it seems untrue.
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
and then when you've heard him see if you agree.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
Ev'ryone I know is sure it shines for you.
Even in my dreams I look into your eyes,
Suddenly it seems I've found a paradise.
Ev'rywhere I go the sun comes shining through.
It means so much to be a part of a heart of a wonderful one.
When other lovers are gone, we'll live on.
We'll live on.
Nobody I know could love me more than you.
You can give me so much love it seems untrue.
Listen to the bird who sings it to the tree
and then when you've heard him see if you agree.
Nobody I know could love you more than me.

Enemies of sinclair, clovers in the hay...
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Nobody ever loved me like she does
Ooo she does, yes she does
And if somebody loved me like she do me
Ooo she do me, yes she does
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
I'm in love for the first time
Don't you know it's gonna last?
It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that had no past
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
And from the first time that she really done me
Ooo she done me, she done me good
I guess nobody ever really done me
Ooo she done me, she done me good
Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
(Eee hee)
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
(Eee hee)
{Don't let me down
Hey, don't let me down
Can you dig it?
Don't let me down}
I want a love that's right, right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down
When I see your smile replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they'll or you'll say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey!
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I know my love is yours to miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here it won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah yeah yeah
To lead a better life
I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with a wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere
And if she's beside me I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching their eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there, and everywhere
Here, there and everywhere

Baby's good to me
You know she's happy as can be
You know she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine
You know she tells me all the time
You know she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things
You know he buys her diamond rings
You know she said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
Baby says she's mine
You know she tells me all the time
You know she said so
I'm in love with her and I feel fine
I'm so glad that she's my little girl
She's so glad, she's telling all the world
That her baby buys her things
You know he buys her diamond rings
You know she said so
She's in love with me and I feel fine
She's in love with me and I feel fine
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more

Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl
You want so much it makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl, girl, girl
When I think of all the times
I tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl, girl, girl
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there
You feel a fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooo, ooo, ooo
Girl, girl, girl
Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Ah, girl, girl, girl
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight

Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Good night
Good night everybody
Everybody everywhere good night
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turns me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't
She don't give boys the eye
She hates to see me cry
She is happy just to hear me
Say that I will never leave her
She don't give boys the eye
She will never make me jealous
Gives me all her time as well as loving
Don't ask me why
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turns me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't, woo
She's a woman who understands
She's a woman who loves her man
My love don't give me presents
I know that she's no peasant
Only ever has to give me
Love forever and forever
My love don't give me presents
Turns me on when I get lonely
People tell me that she's only fooling
I know she isn't
She's a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman

Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
Science in the home
Late nights all alone with her test tube
Oh, oh oh oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures Joan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times, "I must not be so"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
P.C. Thirty One said, "We caught a dirty one"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh oh oh
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
The judge does not agree, and he tells them so
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Silver hammer man!
Well, if your hands start a-clappin'
And your fingers start a-poppin'
And your feet start a-movin' around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move around
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of it
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you
And the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of it
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you
And the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're gonna have a lot of it
Oh don't you worry 'bout a thing
If you start to dance and sing
Until bumps come up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you
And the beat gets you too

There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
There's nothing you can make that can't me made
No one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)
(Love, love, love)
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
All you need is love, all together now
All you need is love, everybody
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Love is all you need

There, there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
I think of you
The things you do
Go 'round my head
The things you've said
Like, "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There, there's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time
When I'm alone
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na, na na, na na na na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you? Hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na, na na, na na na na, yeah
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
Better, better, better, better, better, oh!
Na na na, na-na na na
Na-na na na, hey Jude

(Instrumental) 
I've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you had in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl
'Til the end of time
These days such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Some day when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just the lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is love
And though we may be blind
Love is here to stay and that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Some day when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Da-da da, da-da da da da
Da-da da, da-da da da da
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I got everything that you want
Like a heart that's oh so true
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied, ooh
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
Call on me
To you
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
I got arms that long to hold you
And keep you by my side
I got lips that long to kiss you
And keep you satisfied, ooh
If there's anything that you want
If there's anything I can do
Just call on me and I'll send it along
With love, from me to you
To you, to you, to you
I saw her standing on the corner
A yellow ribbon in her hair
I couldn't stop myself from calling
"Why look a-there, look a-there
Why look a-there, why look a-there"
Hey, young blood
Oh young blood
Hey, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured
I tried to walk but I was lame
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
"Well, what's your name? What's your name?
Well, what's your name? Well, what's your name?"
Hey, young blood
Hey, young blood
Young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
What crazy stuff, she looked so tough
I tried to follow her all the way home
Well, things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Well, I tried to speak but I just stuttered
I saw the rising of the sun
And all along my heart was calling
"Why, you're the one, you're the one
Why, you're the one, why, you're the one"
Hey, young blood
Oh, young blood
Hey, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Hey, young blood
Oh, young blood
Hey, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey, and you
Yours was a kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey
(A taste of honey)
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back
(He'll come back)
For the honey
(For the honey)
And you
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
If you drive a car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman
'Cause I'm the taxman,
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
'cause I'm the taxman,
yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true?
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I gave my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you
Well I'm the sheik of Araby, 
your love belongs to me. 
Well at night where you're asleep, 
into your tent I'll creep. 
The stars that shine above 
will light our way to love. 
You rule this world with me, 
I'm the sheik of Araby. 
Well I'm the sheik of Araby, 
your love belongs to me. 
Oh at night where you're asleep, 
into your tent I'll creep. 
The sun that shines above 
will light our way to love. 
You rule this world with me, 
I'm the sheik of Araby. 
Well I'm the sheik of Araby, 
well I'm the sheik of Araby, yeah.
Oh yeah, all right
Are you gonna be in my dreams tonight?
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
And in the end, the love you take
Is equal to the love you make
It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
(No I can't complain)
The teachers that taught me weren't cool
(No I can't complain)
You're holding me down
(Oww)
Turning me 'round
(Ohh)
Filling me up with your rules
(Ooo)
I've got to admit it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
(It couldn't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word
I finally heard
You're doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
(It couldn't get no worse)
I have to admit it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
I used to be cruel to my woman I beat her
And kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can
(Ooo)
I admit it's getting better
(Better)
A little better all the time
(It couldn't get no worse)
Yes, I admit it's getting better
(Better)
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
It's getting better all the time
(Better, better, better)
Getting so much better all the time
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine

You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans, except on Sunday
So, please, don't ever change
No, don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So, please, don't ever change
No, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So how can I get tired of you?
A lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So, please, don't ever change
No, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always gonna be
As sweet as you are
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please, don't ever change
Don't you
For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter that all the girls and I've met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you this time you'd better stop
For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin she will always be my friend
I don't wanna say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl, another girl
I call your name
But you're not there
Was I to blame
For being unfair?
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on
Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh, I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name
I call your name
I call your name

I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran though the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there
Who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting a room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter
If I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around
They worry me and never ask me
Why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
"I Dig a Pygmy" by Charles Hawtrey and the Deaf-Aids
Phase One in which Doris gets her oats
Two of us riding nowhere
Spending someone's hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving
Not arriving on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
Two of us sending postcards
Writing letters on my wall
You and me burning matches
Lifting latches on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
You and I have memories
Longer than the road
That stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats
Standing solo in the sun
You and me chasing paper
Getting nowhere on our way back home
We're on our way home
We're on our way home
We're going home
We're going home
You better believe it, goodbye
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise

Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend
If it makes you feel all right
I'll get you anything my friend
If it makes you feel all right
'Cause I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love
I'll give you all I've got to give
If you say you love me too
I may not have a lot to give
But what I've got I'll give to you
I don't care too much for money
For money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No no no, no
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love
Everybody tells me so
Can't buy me love
No no no, no
Say you don't need no diamond rings
And I'll be satisfied
Tell me that you want the kind of things
That money just can't buy
I don't care too much for money
Money can't buy me love
Can't buy me love, love
Can't buy me love, oh
You day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words
Of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't
Feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her
When she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone
She doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things
She said will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
He hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that he said I'm gonna get that boy
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rock Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better Doc as soon as I am able"
And now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Martha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please remember me
Martha my love don't forget me

Hold your head up you silly girl
Look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
For each other silly girl
Hold your hand out you silly girl
See what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
You silly girl
Martha my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please be good to me
Martha my love don't forget me

There are no lyrics
This is an instrumental
I was dreaming of the past
And my heart was beating fast
I began to lose control
I began to lose control
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure
You might not love me anymore
I was shivering inside
I was shivering inside
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
I was trying to catch your eye
Thought that you was trying to hide
I was swallowing my pain
I was swallowing my pain
I didn't mean to hurt you
I'm sorry that, I made you cry
I didn't want to hurt you
I'm just a jealous guy
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing 'round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
You know, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho
Oh you could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I run away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho
Oh you could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show
That I'm not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho
Oh you, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques' fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messrs K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, I will send to you
She wrote me only one sad night
Told me she's no longer mine
Shoo, shoo mailman, that will do for sometime
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One more heartache is all I can use
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
I should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey hey hey, and I do!
Whoa, whoa, I never realized what I kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should've realized a lot of things before
If this is love you gotta give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, whoa, I never realized what I kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see?
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're gonna say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
You love me too
You love me too
You love me too

Just a smile would lighten everything
Sexy Sadie, she's the latest and the greatest of them all
She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are

I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
He'd let us in
Knows where we've been
In his octopus' garden
In the shade
I'd ask my friends
To come and see
An octopus' garden
With me
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would be warm
Below the storm
In our little hideaway
Beneath the waves
Resting our head
On the seabed
In an octopus' garden
Near a cave
We would sing
And dance around
Because we know
We can't be found
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
In the shade
We would shout
And swim about
The coral that lies
Beneath the waves
(Lies beneath the ocean waves)
Oh what joy
For every girl and boy
Knowing they're happy
And they're safe
(Happy and they're safe)
We would be so happy
You and me
No one there to tell us
What to do
I'd like to be
Under the sea
In an octopus' garden
With you
In an octopus' garden
With you
In an octopus' garden
With you
Once there was a way,
to get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes,
smilles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way,
to get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
to get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby

Boy you're gonna carry that weight,

Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky
See how they run, I'm crying

Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife
Pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down
I am the eggman
They are the eggmen
I am the walrus

Waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

My tears are falling
'Cause you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There's something that I got to say
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint rainbows all around her
Don't let her see the cloudy sky
Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you
So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby

I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go
I'm an old poor boy
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
'Cause everything I ever did was wrong
Well, if you don't want my peaches
Honey please don't shake my tree

Honey, please don't mess around my tree

Well let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
Watch how your puppy dog runs
Well I said I'm sitting here watching
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
Matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go
There are places I remember all my life
Though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places have their moments
Of lovers and friends I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I loved them all
And with all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these mem'ries lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more
And I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I loved you more
In my life I loved you more

And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha
With the situation
They are standing still
The plan, the telegram
Number 9, number
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to my son
He really can try, as they do, to find function
(Tell what he was saying
(and his voice was low and his hive high)
And his eyes were low
Alright!
It was on fire and his glasses were the same
This thing knows if it was tinted
But you know it isn't
To me it is
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
Number 9
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon to price it
Yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the fucking navy and went to sea
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
How? Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
(Onion soup)
Number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9
(Industry allows financial imbalance)
Number 9
Thrusting it between his shoulder blades
The Watusi, the Twist
El Dorado
Take this, brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh
Maybe, even then, impervious in London
Could be a difficult thing
(It's alright, it's alright, it's alright)
It's quick like rush for peace is because
(It's alright, it's alright)
It's so much like being naked
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
If, you become naked
Hold that line, hold that line, hold that line
Block that kick, block that kick, block that kick
I don't care if I spent my dough
Tonight I'm gonna be one happy soul.
Gonna rock it up,
(Yeah) Gonna shake (ball) it up,
We're gonna roll it up.
Oh, at the ball tonight.
Ah Ho!
Rattle and roll,
I said, shake, rattle and roll,
You never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.
Well, get out of that kitchen
And (rattle) shake those pots and pans,
Well, get out of that kitchen
And (rattle) shake those pots and pans,
I said to my soul.
You're the devil in a frying pan.
Well, I said, shake, rattle and roll,
I said, shake, rattle and roll,
I said, shake, rattle and roll,
I said, shake, rattle and roll,
Well, you never done nothing
To save your doggone soul.
You can knock me down, step on my face,
Slander my name all over the place,
Do the things that you wanna do,
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of them shoes.
But don't you step on my blue suede shoes,
Well, you can do anything but lay off of them
Blue suede shoes.
Ah, go!
You can burn my house, steal my car,
Drink my liquor from an old fruit jar.
Do anything that you want to do,
But ah-hah, honey, lay off of them shoes.
And don't you step on my blue suede shoes, please!
Well, you can do anything but lay off of them
Blue suede shoes.
Ah, go blue cat! (ah, hit it, George!)
Yeah!
Ah, blue cat, go!
Well, its, blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah,
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, babe,
Blue, blue, blue suede shoes, yeah,
Brown, brown, brown suede boots, yeah,
You can do anything but lay off of them
Blue suede shoes.
Ow!
Some other guy, now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
Some other guy, now, has taken away my sweet desire, oh now
Some other guy, now, I just don't wanna hold my hand, oh now
I'm the lonely one as lonely as I can feel, all right
Some other guy is sippin' up the honey like a yellow dog, oh now
Some other guy, now, has taken my love just like I'm gone, oh now
Some other guy, now, has taken my love away from me, oh now
I'm the lonely one as lonely as I can feel, all right now, whoa whoa ho ho
Some other guy, is makin' me very very mad, oh now
Some other guy, now, is makin' my past seem oh so bad, oh now
Some other guy, now, she was the first girl I've ever had, oh now
I'm the lonely one as lonely as I can feel, all right now, whoa whoa ho ho
I'm a-talkin' to you, right now
Hey! Ow!
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
When you do the stroll
Come on Miss Lizzie
Love me 'fore I grow too old
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzie
Oh, girl you look so fine
Just a rocking and a rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
When you call my name
Ooo, baby
Say you're driving me insane
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
I want to be your loving man
Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby don't run and hide
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzie
Girl I want to marry you
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzie
Girl you look so fine
You're just a rocking and a rolling
Ooo, I said I wish you were mine
I'm findin' out what love is all about
And every day, at three, when school lets out
I see my baby I get weak in the knees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
My pappy told me there'll be times like these
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to Rockin' Joe's
The cats are stomping on their heels and toes
I grab my baby, trying to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Well, why must she be such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spends my money, then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for kisses on my bended knees
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin'
Baby, please, please, please?
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day, the wind will blow and the sun will shine
Till that time she puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Yeah
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
She spends my money, then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for her kisses on my bended knees
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin'
Baby, please, please, please?
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day, the wind will blow and the sun will shine
Till that time she puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Ah Kansas City

There are places I remember 
All my life, though some have changed 
Some forever not for better 
Some have gone and some remain 
All these places had their moments 
With lovers and friends 
I still can recall 
Some are dead and some are living 
In my life I've loved them all 
But of all these friends and lovers 
there is no one compares with you 
And these memories lose their meaning 
When I think of love as something new 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
For people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
In my life I love you more 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
For people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
In my life I love you more 
In my life I love you more
It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh how I've been alone 
Wait till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we've cried 
But if your heart breaks 
Don't wait, turn me away 
And if your heart's strong 
Hold on, I won't delay 
Wait till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we've cried 
I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That I've been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
I'll trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 
It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh how I've been alone 
Wait till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we've cried 
I feel as though 
You ought to know 
That I've been good 
As good as I can be 
And if you do 
I'll trust in you 
And know that you 
Will wait for me 
It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh how I've been alone 
Wait till I come back to your side 
We'll forget the tears we've cried 
It's been a long time 
Now I'm coming back home 
I've been away now 
Oh, how I've been alone
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the bands are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there
I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Well I gave you everything I had
But you left me sitting on my own
Did you have to treat me oh so bad?
All I do is hang my head and moan
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
And if something I have said or done
Tell me what and I'll apologize
If you don't I really can't go on
Holding back these tears in my eyes
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Well I'm beggin' on my bended knees
If you'll only listen to my pleas
Is there anything I can do?
'Cause I really can't stand it
I'm so in love with you
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Tell me why you cried
And why you lied to me
Well, let me tell you
Well, no chick made could be the same as sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat as sweet Georgia Brown
Fellas sigh, and even cry for sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why, you know I don't lie
It's been said she knocks 'em dead in any old town
Since she came right it's a shame how she brings 'em down
In Liverpool she even dared to criticize the Beatles' hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean sweet Georgia Brown
I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don't you think so?
Not too commercial, boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music sweet Georgia is known to mind
Don't buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why, use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her living in our hometown
Since she came it's a shame she turns him down
Records that she can get are records they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina but that don't have Georgia Brown
Oh, that sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah, I mean Brown
Oh oh oh, sweet Georgia Brown
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you
Every night when everybody has fun
Here am I sitting all on my own
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you
Since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
Every night the tears come down from my eyes
Every day I've done nothing but cry
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you
Well since you left me, I'm so alone
Now you're coming, you're coming on home
I'll be good like I know I should
You're coming home, you're coming home
So every day we'll be happy I know
Now I know that you won't leave me no more
It won't be long yeah, yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, yeah
It won't be long yeah, till I belong to you, woo

When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream
Please don't wake me
No don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find, there's no need
Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please don't spoil my day
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float upstream
Please don't wake me
No don't shake me
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping
We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves
Behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away
We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there
With our love, with our love
We could save the world
If they only knew
Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking
About the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world
And lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see
Are you one of them
When you've seen beyond yourself
Then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come
When you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without you
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamonds and rings
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Ah rock on, anybody
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
Just cause your trouble
And don't bring your troubles to me
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look, having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh, ahh, ahh
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac in the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Wet beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back in
Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird
Like the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free as a bird
Free

Because the world is round, ah
Because the wind is high, it blows my mind
Because the wind is high, ah
Love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue, ah, ah, ah, ah

Take your partners and do-si-do
When you've got it then let it go
Hold them tight then

Step inside love and stay, 
Step inside love. 
Step inside love. 
Step inside love. 
I want you to stay. 
You look tired, love, 
let me turn down the light. 
Come in out of the cold, 
rest your head on my shoulder 
and kiss me tonight. 
We are together now 
and forever, come my way. 
Step inside love and stay, 
step inside love, 
step inside love, 
step inside love, 
I want you to stay.

I give her all my love
That's all I do
And if you saw my love
You'd love her too
I love her
She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
One day, you'll look
To see I've gone.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
Someday, you'll know
I was the one.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
And now the time has come,
And so, my love, I must go.
And though I loose a friend,
In the end you will know.
One day, you'll find
That I have gone.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
And now the time has come,
And so, my love, I must go.
And though I loose a friend,
In the end you will know.
One day, you'll find
That I have gone.
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun.
Born a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting, singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies, sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Mother Nature's son
Come on, come on

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Helter skelter
Will you, won't you want me to make you?
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you
Tell me, tell me, tell me the answer
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer

Flew in from Miami Beach, BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man, I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the USSR
Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee, it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey, disconnect the phone
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boy
Back in the US, back in the US
Back in the USSR
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on m-m-my mind
Oh, come on
I'm back in the USSR
You don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the USSR
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on m-m-my mind
Oh, show me round the snow-peaked mountains way down south
Take me to you daddy's farm
Let me hear you balalaikas ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the USSR
Hey, you don't know how lucky you are, boys
Back in the USSR
Oh, let me tell you honey
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
Turn off your mind, relax
And float down stream
It is not dying
It is not dying
Lay down all thought
Surrender to the void
It is shining
It is shining
That you may see
The meaning of within
It is being
It is being
That love is all
And love is everyone
It is knowing
It is knowing
That ignorance and hate
May mourn the dead
It is believing
It is believing
But listen to the
Color of your dreams
It is not living
It is not living
Or play the game
Existence to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Whenever I want you around, yeah
All I gotta do is call you on the phone
And you'll come running home

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes I will, whenever you call
You just gotta call on me, yeah
You just gotta call on me
Oh, you just gotta call on me
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations
I break down
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Hello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl
When I see you everyday
I say, mmm mmm, hello little girl
When you're passing on your way
I say, mmm mmm, hello little girl
When I see you passing by
I cry, mmm mmm, hello little girl
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, mmm mmm, hello little girl
I send you flowers
But you don't care
You never seem to see
Me standing there
I often wonder
What you're thinking of
I hope it's me
And love, love, love
So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, mmm mmm
You're my little girl
It's not the first time
That it's happened to me
It's been a long, lonely time
And it's so funny, funny to see
That I'm about to lose my mi-mi-mind
So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, mmm mmm
You're my little girl, mmm mmm mmm
You're my little girl, mmm mmm mmm
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl 
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du
I dream of you first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey, and you
Do dut don du, to dut don du
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back, I'll come back
For the honey, for the honey
And you
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me, will my love grow?
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
The best things in life are free

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder, should I get up and fix myself a drink?
No no no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder, should I call you? But I know what you would do
You'd say I'm putting you on, but it's no joke
It's doing me harm, you know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain, you know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid get
You'd say I'm putting you on, but it's no joke
It's doing me harm, you know I can't sleep
I can't stop my brain, you know it's three weeks
I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'll give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'll give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind

You can't cry 'cause you're laughing at me
I'm down
(I'm really down)
I'm down
(Down on the ground)
I'm down
(I'm really down)
How can you laugh, when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh, when you know I'm down?
Man buys ring, woman throws it away
Same old thing happen every day
I'm down
(I'm really down)
I'm down
(Down on the ground)
I'm down
(I'm really down)
How can you laugh, when you know I'm down?
How can you laugh, when you know I'm down?
We're all alone and there's nobody else
She'll still moan, "Keep your hands to yourself"
I'm down
(I'm really down)
Ah babe I'm down
(Down on the ground)

How can you laugh, when you know I'm down?

It's been a long, long, long time
How could I ever have lost you
When I loved you?
It took a long, long, long time
Now I'm so happy I found you
How I love you
So many tears I was searching
So many tears I was wasting, oh oh
Now I can see you be you
How can I ever misplace you?
How I want you
Oh, I love you
You know that I need you
Oh, I love you
(Instrumental) 
There are places I remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends
I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life I love you more
In my life I love you more
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all-American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mommy butted in
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
I met you in the morning
Waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
There were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was you
I don't like you but I love you
Seems that I'm always thinking of you
Oh ho ho, you treat me badly
I love you madly, you've really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
Baby, I don't want you but I need you
Don't want to kiss you but I need to
Oh ho ho, you do me wrong now
My love is strong now, you've really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
Baby, I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter, tighter
I want to leave you, don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend another day here
Oh ho ho, I want to split now
I just can quit now, you've really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
Baby, I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, please, hold me, squeeze, hold me, hold me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
It's not the way you smile
That touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss
That tears me apart
Uh oh, many, many, many, nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
You should hear what they say about you
Cheat, cheat
They say, they say you never, never, ever been true
Cheat, cheat
Whoa oh, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do? Then it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Whoa oh, it doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do, when it's true?
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause baby it's you
Baby it's you
Don't leave me all alone
Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave and go away
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye
Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for the one who waits behind
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye
Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on, I must be by his side
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love goodbye
Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, ha
Bye, bye

Well, you can indicate everything you see
Yes, you can indicate anything you see
Oh now!
I, cold and lonely
Well, you can syndicate any boat you row
Yeah, you can syndicate any boat you row
I told you so
All I want is you
Everything has got to be just like you want it to
Because
Oh ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she sweet?
Oh ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you very confidentially
Ain't she nice?
Just cast an eye
In her direction
Oh me oh my

Well don't you think that's kind of neat?
Yes I ask you very confidentially

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie, writing the words
of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
(Ah, look at all the lonely people)
Where do they all belong?
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, a
Nothing to do
To save his life
Call his wife in
Nothing to say
But what a day
How's your boy been?
Nothing to do
It's up to you
I've got nothing to say
But it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, a
Going to work
Don't want to go
Feeling lowdown
Heading for home
You start to roam
Then you're in town
Everybody knows
There's nothing doing
Everything is closed
It's like a ruin
Everyone you see
Is half asleep
And you're on your own
You're in the street
After a while
You start to smile
Now you feel cool
Then you decide
To take a walk
By the old school
Nothing has changed
It's still the same
I've got nothing to say
But it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning
Good morning, a
People running 'round
It's five o'clock
Everywhere in town
It's getting dark
Everyone you see
Is full of life
It's time for tea
And meet the wife
Somebody needs
To know the time
Glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts
You start to flirt
No you're in gear
Go to a show
You hope she goes
I've got nothing to say
But it's O.K.
Good morning, good morning

Good morning, good morning

Good morning, good morning

Running to and fro, 
hard working at the mill, 
never failed at the mill, 
there come a rotten bill. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Salesman talking to me, 
trying to run me up a creek, 
Says you can buy it, go on try it, 
you can pay me next week. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Blonde hair, good-looking, 
trying to get me hooked and married 
Get a home, settle down by the book. 
Too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Been to Yokohama, baby, 
fighting in the war, 
Army bunk, army chow, 
army clothes, army car. 
Too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Same thing every day, 
getting up, going to school. 
No need for me complaining, 
my objection's overruled. 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved again. 
Working in the filling station, 
too many tasks, 
Wipe the windows, check the oil, 
check the tires, dollar gas? 
Aw too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
Don't want you by the race, 
get away and leave me. 
[Original has one more verse: 
Pay-phone, something's wrong, 
dime gone, will mail. 
Oughta sue the operator 
for telling me a tale. 
Too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business, 
too much monkey business 
for me to be involved with you.]

Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah
I wanna tell you pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darling, I'm imprisoned by these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Oh, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, chains of love
Chains of love, chains of love
If you leave me, baby
I don't know what I'll do
I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye

Mm, some god damned insurance on me, baby
If you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Try to see it my way
Do I have to keep on talking
Till I can't go on?
While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing that
Our love may soon be gone
We can work it out
We can work it out
Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong and still
You think that it's all right
Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and
Get it straight or say good night
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell
If I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might
Fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend
I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again
Try to see it my way
Only time will tell
If I am right or I am wrong
While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might
Fall apart before too long
We can work it out
We can work it out
Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.
It's getting hard to be someone but it all works out, it doesn't matter much to me.
Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
No one I think is in my tree, I mean it must be high or low.
That is you can't you know tune in but it's all right, that is I think it's not too bad.
Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Always, no sometimes, think it's me, but you know I know when it's a dream.
I think I know I mean a 'Yes' but it's all wrong, that is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down, 'cos I'm going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real and nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I wanna tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyfull of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm gonna make her mine
Oh, yeah, someday I'm gonna make her mine
Not guilty
For getting in your way
While you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest
I'm not trying to steal your vest
I am not trying to be smart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your aging head
But like you heard me said
"Not guilty"
No use handing me a writ
While I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed
But like you heard me said
"Not guilty"
Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been misled
But like you heard me said
"Not guilty"

Hold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
Says, "Baby everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I, I love that chick so
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you I can say
I'm never, never never never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Well, there's gonna be a time
When I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me
Oh yeah
Imagine I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined I'm in love with you
Many, many many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes, I will, I'll get you in the end
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you, Julia
Julia, Julia
Ocean child calls me
So I sing the song of love, Julia
Julia
Seashell eyes, windy smile calls me
So I sing the song of love
Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun
Julia, Julia
Morning moon touch me
So I sing the song of love
Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind
Julia
Julia
Sleeping sand, silent cloud touch me
So I sing the song of love
Julia
Calls me
So I sing the song of love for Julia
Julia, Julia
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
Ah, ah, ah
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream
Came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes it did
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
All good children go to heaven
Ã¢Â¦
Why why can't we love again?
Why why are you shy on love?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?
Why why don't you open your heart?
Why why are we so far apart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?
I just want your loving arms around me, yeah
I got to find a way to make you take me back
Baby won't you tell me

Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die
Yes, I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Woo! Girl you know the reason why
In the morning, wanna die
In the evening, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Woo! Girl you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Woo! Girl you know the reason why
The eagle picks my eyes
The worm he licks my bone
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Woo! Girl you know the reason why
The black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Wanna die, yeah, wanna die
If I ain't dead already
Woo! Girl you know the reason why
Well gonna write a little letter 
Gonna mail it to my local D.J. 
It's a rockin' little record 
I want my jockey to play 
Roll over Beethoven 
I gotta hear it again today 
You know my temperature's risin' 
and the jukebox's blowin' a fuse 
My hearts beatin' rhythm 
and my soul keeps singing the blues 
Roll over Beethoven 
and tell Tchaikovsky the news 
I got a rockin' pneumonia 
I need a shot of rhythm and blues 
I think I got it off the writer 
sittin' down by the rhythm review 
Roll over Beethoven

Well if you fell you like it 
Well get your lover and reel and rock it

Dance like a spinnin' top 
She got a crazy partner

Long as she's got a dime 
the music will never stop 
Roll over Beethoven 
Roll over Beethoven 
Roll over Beethoven 
Roll over Beethoven 
Roll over Beethoven

Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no sometimes, think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean a yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down
'Cause I'm going to Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxies appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah
Picture yourself in a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Well she was just seventeen 
You know what I mean 
And the way she looked 
Was way beyond compare 
So how could I dance with another, 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
Well she looked at me 
and I, I could see 
That before too long 
I'd fall in love with her 
She wouldn't dance with another 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
Well my heart went boom 
When I crossed that room 
And I held her hand in mine 
Oh we danced through the night 
And we held each other tight 
And before too long 
I fell in love with her 
Now I'll never dance with another 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
Well my heart went boom 
When I crossed that room 
And I held her hand in mine 
Oh we danced through the night 
And we held each other tight 
And before too long 
I fell in love with her 
Now I'll never dance with another 
Oh, when I saw her standing there 
Oh, since I saw her standing there 
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there
What you're doing - The Beatles
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely,
would it be too much to ask you,
what you're doing to me?
You got me running and there's no fun in it,
why should it be so much to ask of you,
what you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you,
wond'ring what you're gonna do,
should you need a love that's true,
it's me.
Please stop your lying, you've got me crying, girl,
why should it be so much to ask of you,
what you're doing to me?
What you're doing to me.
There's a fog upon L.A.
And my friends have lost their way
"We'll be over soon" they said
Now they've lost themselves instead
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep
Well it only goes to show
And I told them where to go
Ask a policeman on the street
There's so many there to meet
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep
Now it's past my bed I know
And I'd really like to go
Soon will be the break of day
Sitting here in Blue Jay Way
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Or I may be asleep
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Please don't be long
Please don't you be very long
Please don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
Don't be long
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps
I once had a girl
Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
Well, come on pretty baby won't you walk with me
Come on pretty baby won't you talk with me
Come on pretty baby give me one more chance
Try and save our romance
Slow down

Slow down
Baby, now you're moving way too fast
You gotta gimme little loving
Gimme little loving
Ow, if you want our love to last
This happened once before
When I came to your door, no reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you I'd realize that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no reply
Oh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
Oh please say to me
You'll let me be your man
And please say to me
You'll let me hold your hand
You'll let me hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I say that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide
Yeah, you got that something
I think you'll understand
When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
Before this dance is through I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't wanna kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just wanna dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you

If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I told you 'bout strawberry fields
You know the place where nothing is real
Well, here's another place you can go
Where everything flows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half live
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the walrus and me, man
You know that we're as close as can be, man
Well, here's another clue for you all
The walrus was Paul
Standing on the cast iron shore, yeah
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Looking through a glass onion
I told you 'bout the fool on the hill
I tell you man he living there still
Well, here's another place you can be
Listen to me
Fixing a hole in the ocean
Trying to make a dovetail joint, yeah
Looking through a glass onion
Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there a heaven lies
And as I look I see the love of the loved
Someday they'll see that from the start
My place has been deep in your heart
And in your heart I see the love of the loved
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure you love me
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me
So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved
Though I said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure you love me
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me
And say ah you love me
So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved
As I was slowly passing an orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while to watch the children play
Alone, a boy was standing and when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see and he began to cry
I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses, I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child
No mummy's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven where all blinds can see
And just like for the other kids it will be a home for me
I'm nobody's child, I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses, I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me, I'm nobody's child
When I get older, losing my hair, many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine, birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out 'til quarter to three, would you lock the door?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
Ah, and if you say the word, I could stay with you
I could be handy, mending a fuse when your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside, Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight if it's not to, dear
We shall scrimp and save
Ah, grandchildren on your knee, Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say, yours sincerely wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form, mine forever more
Will you still need me, will you still feed me when I'm sixty-four?
She was a working girl north of England way
Now she's hit the big time in the USA
And if she could only hear me this is what I'd say
Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Oh honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh honey pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
I like it like that, ooh ah
I like this kinda hot kinda music, hot kinda music
Play it to me, play it to me honey with blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Now honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home?
Come, come back to me honey pie
Honey pie, honey pie
[instrumental]
The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true?
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I've found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I gave my heart to you
I must be sure from the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad
If our new love was in vain
So I hope you see
That I would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques' fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messrs K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look, having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up, I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
Ahh, ahh, ahh
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want or need to hold your hand
Well it's only try and understand
'cause there's really nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to kiss or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
I discovered I'm in love with you
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Maybe I'm Amazed At The Way You Love Me All The Time
Maybe I'm Afraid Of The Way I Love You
Maybe I'm Amazed At The Way You Pulled Me Out Of Time
And Hung Me On A Line
Maybe I'm Amazed At The Way I Really Need You
Maybe I'm A Man Maybe I'm A Lonely Man
Who's In The Middle Of Something
That He Doesn't Really Understand
Maybe I'm A Man And Maybe You're The Only Woman
Who Could Ever Help Me
Baby Won't You Help Me Understand, 
Maybe I'm A Man, Maybe I'm A Lonely Man
Who's In The Middle Of Something
That He Doesn't Really Understand
Maybe I'm A Man And Maybe You're The Only Woman
Who Could Ever Help Me
Baby Won't You Help Me Understand, Oohhh
Maybe I'm Amazed At The Way You're With Me All The Time
Maybe I'm Afraid Of The Way I Leave You
Maybe I'm Amazed At The Way You Help Me Sing My Song
Right Me When I'm Wrong
Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you

Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue

She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her
But she only thinks of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue

Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
Deep down in Louisianna 
close to New Orleans, 
way back up in the woods 
among the evergreens, 
there stand a country cabin 
made of clay and wood, 
where lives a young country boy 
named Johnny B.Goode, 
he never ever learned 
to read or write a book so well, 
but he could play his guitar 
just like a-ringing a bell. 
Go go, go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
aah Johnny B.Goode! 
He used to carry his guitar 
in a gunny sack, 
sit beneath the trees 
by the railroad track. 
Oh sitting and a-playing 
in the shade, 
drumming to the rhythm 
that the drivers made. 
People passing by 
used to stop and say: 
my oh my, 
that country boy can play. 
Go go, go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Aah Johnny B.Goode! 
Well his mama told him: 
someday you will be a man. 
And you will be the leader 
of a big old band. 
Many people coming 
from miles around, 
to hear you play your music 
till the sun goes down. 
Maybe some day 
your name will be in light, 
saying: Johnny 
B. Goode tonight! 
Go go, go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
Go Johnny go go go! 
aah Johnny B.Goode!
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at 15 clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeah
IT'S FOR YOU
WRITERS JOHN LENNON, PAUL McCARTNEY
I'd say some day
I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I 
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for you
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage on the
Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine forever more
Will you still need me
Will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Hoo!

Since she's been gone I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away and leave me alone, don't bother me
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But 'til she's here, please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home, until that the day
Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now, don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But 'til she's here, please don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home, until that the day
Don't come around, leave me alone, don't bother me
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Don't bother me, don't bother me
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in the ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home and nearly made it
Sitting on a sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
(Lovely Rita meter maid)
Lovely meter maid
(Lovely Rita meter maid)
Rita meter maid
(Lovely Rita meter maid)
Oh, lovely Rita meter, meter maid
Lovely Rita meter maid
You say you want a revolution
Well you know
We all wanna change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well you know
We all wanna change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
You say you got a real solution
Well you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You asked me for a contribution
Well you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
You say you'll change the constitution
Well you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Don't you know it's gonna be alright?
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright
Ã¢Â¦
When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
I don't know why you
Should want to hide
But I can't get through
My hands are tied
I won't want to stay
I don't have much to say
But I can't turn away
And you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few
They're filled with tears
And since I lost you
It feels like years
Yes, it seems so long
Girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
All my loving, I will send to you
All my loving, darling I'll be true
All my loving, all my loving
Ooh, all my loving, I will send to you
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?

Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
Why don't we do it in the road?
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road?
I'm gonna search this town, 
from door to door. 
The love I crave 
I can't find no more. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I ain't had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye. 
You know I hate to see the sun 
sinking to the west, 
'cos I know my whole life's 
gonna be one solid mess. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I ain't had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye. 
Well ever since the day 
that she said we were through, 
I've been nervous 
and shook up too. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye. 
Well I don't care if the last thing 
I ever do in my life, 
is to find that little woman 
make her my wife. 
I got to find my baby, 
I declare there ain't no lie. 
I had no real good loving 
since that woman said goodbye.
It feels so right
Now hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you
Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right
Now hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you
Don't know what it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you
It feels so right
Now hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you
So hold me tight
Tonight, tonight
It's you, you you you
You
Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World"
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do
And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you
And bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do
And it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you
And bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
Oh dirty Maggie Mae they have taken her away

I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realize I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Have you see the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt
To play around in
Have you see the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts
To play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a darn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives
To eat their bacon
One more time
I, I saw a girl in my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love her
Oh you, you are that girl
In my dreams
And so it seems
That I will love you
And I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss
Like dreamers do
And I, I, I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello

And I, I, I waited for your kiss
Waited for the bliss

And I, I, I
Oh I'll be there, yeah
Waiting for you, you, you
You, you came just one dream ago
And now I know that I will love you
Oh I knew when you first said hello

Waited for the bliss

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her
But she only thinks of him
And though it's only a whim

Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear, what can I do?

Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I got every reason on earth to be mad
'Cause I just lost the only girl I had
If I could get my way
I'd get myself locked up today
But I can't, so I'll cry instead
I got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger that my feet
I can't talk to people that I meet
If I could see you now
I'd try to make you sad somehow
But I can't, so I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday
And when you do you better hide all the girls
I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
Don't want to cry when there's people there
I get shy when they start to stare
I'm gonna hide myself away
But I'll come back again someday
And when you do you better hide all the girls
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all round the world
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two
And show you what your lovin' man can do
Until then I'll cry instead
I never knew that a day
Like today lay before us
I've got the sun in my heart
And my heart's in the sun
Skies are as bright
As your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reeling
Free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound
To each other by love?
To each other by love
Who ever knew that we two
Could be free as we'd fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound
To each other by love?
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by love
Love, love me do

Mean Mr. Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark, trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Ringo: I'm Ringo and I play the drums.
Paul: Eh, oh, I'm Paul and I play the, eh, eh, bass.
George: I'm George and I play the guitar.
John: I'm John and I, too, play the guitar. Sometimes, I play the fool. 
Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it, 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
I've got no kick against modern jazz 
Unless they try to play it too darn fast 
And change the beauty of the melody 
Until they sound just like a symphony 
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it, 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
I took my loved one over 'cross the tracks 
So she can hear my man awail a sax 
I must admit they have a rockin' band 
Man, they were goin' like a hurrican' 
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it, 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
Way down South they gave a jubilee 
The jokey folks they had a jamboree 
They're drinkin' home brew from a water cup 
The folks dancin' got all shook up 
And started playin' that that rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it, 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me 
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango 
I'm in the mood to gear a mambo 
It's way to early for a congo 
So keep a rockin' that piano 
So I can gear some of that 
Rock and roll music 
Any old way you choose it 
It's got a back beat, you can't lost it, 
Any old time you use it 
It's gotta be rock roll music 
If you wanna dance with me 
If you wanna dance with me
When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now
There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, ooh
Every little thing
Every little thing
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you?
Every single day of my life
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You know I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again for I had told you
Ooo, you were meant to be near me
Ooo, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true I'll never leave
And if I do I know the way there
Ooo, then I suddenly see you
Ooo, did I tell you I need you?
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
I got to get you into my life
I was alone, I took a ride
I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
And suddenly I see you
Did I tell you I need you?
Every single day
We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line
Keep your hands off my baby
(Keep your hands)
Ain't a-gonna tell you but a one more time
So keep your hands off my baby
(Keep your hands)
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
Jewelry and such
Here is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch
Keep your hands off my baby
(Keep your hands)
Ain't a-gonna tell you but a one more time
So keep your hands off my baby
(Keep your hands)
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
Ow, baby!
Keep your hands off my baby
(Keep your hands)
Ain't a-gonna tell you but a one more time
So keep your hands off my baby
(Keep your hands)
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
(Keep your hands)
Oh keep your hands off my baby, now
(Off my baby)
She's mine
(Keep your hands off my baby)
You better watch your step now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me
Spread the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, it's sunshine
It's the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
Say the word love
One day
You'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
Some day
You'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
Yet tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
Instrumentation
Orchestration arranged by George Martin
Standing in the dock at Southampton
Trying to get to Holland or France
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back"
You know they didn't even give us a chance
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say, "You can make it O.K.
You can get married in Gibraltar near Spain"
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, "Say, what're you doing in bed?"
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace!"
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said, "Oh boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul, think!"
Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspapers said, "She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag"
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack
The men from the press said, "We wish you success
It's good to have the both of you back"
Christ! You know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
The way things are going
They're going to crucify me
I got something to say that might cause you pain
If I catch you talking to that boy again
I'm gonna let you down and leave you flat
Because I told you before, oh, you can't do that
Well it's the second time I caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time I think it's a sin?
I think I'll let you down
(Let you down)
And leave you flat
(Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before, oh, you can't do that
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way they'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'm gonna let you down
(Let you down)
And leave you flat
(Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
You can't do that
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way they'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you wanna stay mine
I can't help my feelings, I'll go out of my mind
I'll go and let you down
(Let you down)
And leave you flat
 (Gonna let you down and leave you flat)
Because I told you before
Oh, you can't do that
Lend me your comb
It's time to go home
I gotta go fast
My hair is a mess
Your mommy will scold
Your pappy will shout
Unless we come in
The way we went out
Kissing you was fun honey
But thanks for the date
I must come to run honey
But you know baby it's a getting late
Just wait till I
Say, "My darlin'
Lend me your comb"
We gotta go home
Kissing you was fun honey
But thanks for the date
But I must come to run honey
But a sugar bugger it's a getting late
Just wait till I
Say, "My darling
Lend me your comb"
We gotta go home
Well I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Well I know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
I catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Na, na, na

It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
"You're gonna give me everything"
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel all right
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel okay, oh!
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel all right
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog

Tomorrow I'll miss you
Remember I'll always be true
And then while I'm away
I'll write home every day
And I'll send all my loving to you
I'll pretend that I'm kissing
The lips I am missing
And hope that my dreams will come true
And then while I'm away

But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one

Day after day
Alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way
Head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, an' round, an' round, an' round, an' round
He never listens to them
He knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, an' round, an' round, an' round
Oh
A bad little kid
Moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right
Just a sitting got to look so good
He don't wanna go to school
And learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays
That rock and roll music all night
Well he put thumb tacks on teacher's chair
Put chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now Junior, behave yourself!
Buys every rock and roll book
On the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets
Oh he's off to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher
Till at night she's already to poop
From rocking and a rolling
Spinning in a hula-hoop
Well his rock and roll has gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now Junior, behave yourself, ow!
Gonna tell ya mamma
You'd better do what she said
Get to the barber shop
And get that hair cut off your head
You shoot the canary
and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You have the cocker spaniel
A bath in mother's Laundromat
Well ya mamma said it's gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as a rock
Now Junior, behave yourself! Woo
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Sing it again
Let's all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know
Your mother should know
Lift up your hearts and sing me a song
That was a hit before your mother was born
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know

Without going out of my door
I can know all things on earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on earth
With out looking out of your window
You can know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without traveling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
Rattle and roll, 
I said shake, rattle, and roll
Well you never do nothing 
To save your doggone soul 
Well get out of that kitchen
And shake those pots and pans 
I said get out of that kitchen 
And shake those pots and pans 
I said to my soul: 
You're the devil in the frying pan 
Well I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll
I said shake, rattle, and roll 
Well you never do nothing 
To save your doggone soul
Long distance information 
give me Memphis Tennessee. 
Try to find the party 
trying to get in touch with me. 
She would not leave her number 
but I know who placed the call. 
'Cos my uncle took the message 
and he wrote it on the wall. 
Help me, information, 
get in touch with my Marie. 
She's the only one who'd phone me here 
from Memphis Tennessee. 
Her home is on the south side 
just beyond the ridge, 
just a half a mile 
from the Mississippi Bridge. 
Help me, information, 
more than that I cannot add. 
Only that I miss her 
and all the fun we had. 
We were pulled apart 
because her mom would not agree. 
Help me get in touch with her 
in Memphis Tennessee. 
The last time I saw Marie 
she was waving me goodbye, 
with hurry homedrops on her cheek 
that trickled from her eyes. 
Marie is only six years old, 
information please. 
Help me get in touch with her 
in Memphis Tennessee.

He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all 'til somebody else lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere Man, please listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
If you let me take your heart
I will prove to you
We will never be apart
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
Big and black the clouds may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realize now
What you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?
Can't you try to see that
I'm tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
Tell me what you see
Listen to me one more time
How can I get through?

I'm tryin' to get to you?
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less, 
And the dream I had was true
Yes, the dream I had was true
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
Sunlight shining in your eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes, my thoughts return to home
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one nature's children
Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind that never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
Three cool cats
Three cool cats
A-hung on the corner in a beat up car
Splitting up a nip of candy bar
Talking all about how sharp they are
These three cool cats
Three cool chicks
Are walking down the street swinging their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
And three cool cats did three big flips for
Three cool chicks
Yeah, three cool chicks
Well up popped that first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well, I want that middle chick!"
"I want that little chick!"
"Hey, man save one chick for me!"
Well, three cool chicks
Three cool chicks
Well, they looked like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks made three fools of
Those three cool cats
Three cool cats
Well, up popped that first cool cat
He said "Man look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well, now I want that middle chick!"
"I want that little chick!"
"Hey, man save one chick for me!"
Three cool chicks
Three cool chicks
They looked like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks made three fools of
These three cool cats
Three cool cats
Three cool cats
Three cool cats

Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It's not always been this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day
Darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving
At the right time
It's not always
Going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
The king of marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlor
Playing piano for the children of the king
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The Duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local bird and bee
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry, cry, cry, cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry, cry, cry, cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Can you take me back where I came from?

I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know
I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong, I've waited far too long
I think I'll take a walk and look for her
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go
I would hate my disappointment to show
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know
Though tonight she's made me sad
I still love her
If I find her I'll be glad
I still love her
Though I've had a drink or two and I don't care
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there
I wonder what went wrong and waited far too long
But I think I'll take a walk and look for her
My baby says she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around, only fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
Said she's traveling on the one after 909
Picked up my bags, run to the station
Railman says you got the wrong location
Picked up the bag, run right home
Then I find I got the number wrong
Well, said she's traveling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm traveling on that line

Love you whenever we're together
Love you when we're apart
And when at last I find you
Your song will fill the air
Sing it loud so I can hear you
Make it easy to be near you
For the things you do endear you to me
Oh, you know I will, I will

I forgot to remember to forget her, 
I can't seem to get her off my mind. 
I thought I'd never miss her, 
but I've found out somehow 
I think about her almost all the time. 
Well the day she went away 
I made myself I promise 
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met. 
But something sure is wrong 
'cos I'm so blue and lonely: 
I forgot to remember to forget. 
Well the day she went away 
I made myself I promise 
that I'd soon forget we'd ever met. 
But something sure is wrong 
'cos I'm so blue and lonely: 
I forgot to remember to forget.

But she was a frying pan
The picker, picture the fingers
Ok
Jo Jo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it couldn't last
Jo Jo left his home in Tucson, Arizona
For some California grass

I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves
I hope we passed the audition
Besame, besame mucho
Each time I bring you a kiss
I hear music divine
So besame, besame mucho
I'll love you forever
Say that you'll always be mine
Dearest one if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh besame, besame mucho
Ooh love me forever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh this joy is something new
My arms are folding you
I never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "It's you I adore"
Yes, oh dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh so besame, besame mucho
Yeah I'll love you forever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh this joy is something new
My arms are folding you
I never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "It's you I adore"
Oh so dearest one if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh so besame, besame mucho
And I'll love you forever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love me forever
Make all my dreams come true
Ooh love me forever
Make all my dreams come true

They're really rocking in Boston, 
in Philadelphia PA, 
deep in the heart of Texas, 
on down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis 
and down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
sweet little sixteen. 
Sweet little sixteen, 
she's just got to have 
about half a million 
framed autopraphs. 
Her wall is filled with pictures, 
she gets them one by one. 
Becomes so excited, 
oh watch her at the run boy. 
Oh mommy mommy, 
please may I go. 
You know it's such a sight to see 
somebody steal the show. 
Oh daddy daddy, 
I beg of you. 
Please say it to mommy 
it's alright with you. 
Sweet little sixteen 
she's got the grown up blues. 
Tight dresses and lipstick, 
she's sporting in high heeled boots. 
Oh but tomorrow morning 
she'll have to change her trend 
become sweet sixteen 
and back in class again. 
They're really rocking in Boston, 
in Philadelphia PA, 
deep in the heart of Texas 
and down the Frisco Bay. 
All over Saint Louis, 
on down in New Orleans. 
All the cats want to dance with 
sweet little sixteen.
She's got the devil in her heart
But her eyes they tantalize
She's gonna tear your heart apart
Oh, her lips they really thrill me
I'll take my chances
For romance is so important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?
She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no no no, this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No no, nay will she deceive
Don't take chances
If your romance is so important to you
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
Oh, no no no, no this I can't believe
She's gonna tear your heart apart
No no, nay will she deceive
She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me
She's got the devil in her heart
No, she's an angel sent to me
There are no lyrics
This is an instrumental
Ain't no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooo baby I don't Gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah the goose pimples baby
'Cos I feel so good
When you cuddle me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooo mercy, I'm a rock-gone pappy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over
Your touch goes through me
Like an electric wire
Never thought of make love
It don't take much luck
To see what I've got
But it shows, yes it shows
Come on honey bunny
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooo baby, I don't Gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Tried to tell you how I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature's low
Fever is high
I can't speak
I'm too weak
Well come on honey bunny
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well I feel glad all over
Ooo baby, I don't Gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Hot dog Gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Well hot dog Gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
They're gonna put me in the movies
They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
Well, I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Oh carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day.
Well come into my machine
So we can move on out.
I know a jumping little joint
Where we can jump and shout.
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride.
You take your car along
And you park it outside.
A little cutie takes your hat
And you can thank her, ma'am,
'cos every time you're gonna drive,
You find the joint is jammed.
Oh carol, don't let him
Steal your heart away.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day. auw.
Well if you want to hear some music
Like the boys all play,
Hold tight, tap your foot,
Don't let it carry you away.
Don't let the heat overcome you
'cos they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd.
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought.
I got my eyes on you baby,
'cos you dance so good.
Don't let him
Steal your heart away.
I've got to learn to dance
If it takes me all night and day.
Well I've got to learn to dance
If it takes you all night and day.
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlegs
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Pa, pa, pa
See how they run
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
You say yes, I say no
You say stop and I say go, go, go
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
I say high, you say low
You say why and I say I don't know
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
 (Hello goodbye, hello goodbye)
Hello, hello
(Hello goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
 (Hello goodbye, hello goodbye)
Hello, hello
(Hello goodbye)
I don't know why you say goodbye
(Hello goodbye)
I say hello
Why, why, why, why, why, why
Do you say goodbye?
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
You say yes
(I say yes)
I say no
(But I may mean no)
You say stop
(I can stay)
And I say go, go, go
('Til it's time to go)
Oh, no
You say goodbye and I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye
I say hello
Hello, hello
I don't know why you say goodbye I say hello
Hello

A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you that means a lot
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know that this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you that means a lot
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide
What you feel when it's real?
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got

A soldier of love is hard to be. 
Lay down your arms of love, 
and let the peacefully.
